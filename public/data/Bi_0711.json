(ISI), an instrument posing seven questions to assess current (i.e., preceding 2 weeks) sleep characteristics. The first three items pose questions related to sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning awakening. Subsequent items assess the degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the current sleep pattern, how the current sleep pattern interferes with daily functioning, how noticeable the impairment attributed to the sleep problem is, and how worrisome the current sleep problem is.

participants filled in a written version of the German International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF). The IPAQ-SF assesses time spent in moderate physical activity (e.g., bicycling at a regular pace, low-intensity sports such as doubles tennis) and vigorous physical activity (e.g., fast bicycling, running, aerobics), using a frequency-by-duration format. Thus, participants first reported the number of days per week they engaged in these activities (from 0 to 7 days), and then indicated the average duration (in minutes) for the days they engaged in these activities. Participants were asked to refer to the last week prior to admission to the hospital. Multiplication of frequency and duration scores resulted in an estimate of weekly hours invested in moderate and vigorous physical activity. Summing up these two scores resulted in a total score for time (in min\/week) spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).

The TSST consists of two standardised 5-min tasks including a free speech task (job interview) and a mental arithmetic task (counting backwards in steps of 13 from a 4-digit number). At both measurement occasions, the TSST was performed in front of a jury of two people unknown to the patient. Patients were also informed that the test would be videotaped to evaluate their behaviour. Patients had 5 min to prepare themselves for the speech task, before they entered the test room. The test was completed in a standing position. After completion of the TSST, participants recovered in a separate room for a period of 60 min. In the present study, the TSST was carried out exactly at 2 p.m. to control for circadian variations of cortisol levels. The participants were also asked to refrain from eating, drinking (except for water) and from any moderate or vigorous intensity physical activity 2 h prior to the beginning of the stress protocol. While previous research has shown that participation in physical activity prior to the TSST might have acute effects on stress reactivity, researchers also showed that cortisol levels typically return to the level prior to the TSST within two hours after individual have stopped exercise participation. All participants were unaware of the experimental protocol. Because stress reactions depend on the novelty of the stressor task, responses might be less strong if the same psychosocial stressor task is performed a second time. However, researchers showed that the stressfulness of the TSST can be maintained if the stressor tasks are modified. We therefore slightly changed the content of the free speech task (application for a promotion\/prize) and mental arithmetic tasks (counting backwards in steps of 13 from a different number), but ensured that the socio-evaluative pressure of the stressor protocol was maintained.

The task involves the presentation of a sequence of letters, and respondents have to detect whether or not the current letter matched the letter presented 1 or 2 trials earlier in the series. For each trial, participants are asked to respond by pressing a button corresponding to yes or no. In the present study participants completed the task at two levels of difficulty (one-back and two-back). The stimuli were dark gray letters (vertical visual angle = 0.7\u00b0) presented on a light gray background. Each letter in the sequence was displayed for 500 ms, and a response window of 1,500 ms was provided. The inter-stimulus interval was set at 1,000 ms.

The task involves the presentation of a sequence of letters, and respondents have to detect whether or not the current letter matched the letter presented 1 or 2 trials earlier in the series. For each trial, participants are asked to respond by pressing a button corresponding to yes or no. In the present study participants completed the task at two levels of difficulty (one-back and two-back). The stimuli were dark gray letters (vertical visual angle = 0.7\u00b0) presented on a light gray background. Each letter in the sequence was displayed for 500 ms, and a response window of 1,500 ms was provided. The inter-stimulus interval was set at 1,000 ms.

The reliability,  construct, and criterion validity of the scores of Italian participants  on the ODI-I have been well established in various samples of adults. The participants were asked to complete the ODI-I and give  their answers based on the statement they felt applied to them. Each question is scored on a scale of 0 (minimal disability) to 5 (severe disability).  A maximum score of 50 was allowed.  The score  obtained by an individual subject can be multiplied by 2, and this  will provide a percentage score.

Associative memory refers to memory for the relationships between memoranda rather than memory for objects themselves. The role of the hippocampus in memory formation has also been specifically linked to associative memory. A specific version of an associative paradigm using face-name pairing known to reliably activate the hippocampus during the successful encoding event and sensitive enough to detect hippocampal dysregulation in a MDD sample was used to investigate activation patterns of the hippocampus during the encoding process inside the MRI scanner. During the encoding phase inside the MRI, participants were presented with face-name pairs and used a response box provided to indicate if the name suited the face.

The role of the hippocampus in memory formation has also been specifically linked to associative memory. A specific version of an associative paradigm using face-name pairing known to reliably activate the hippocampus during the successful encoding event and sensitive enough to detect hippocampal dysregulation in a MDD sample was used to investigate activation patterns of the hippocampus during the encoding process inside the MRI scanner.

The procedure was repeated in triplicate.  The washed cells were immediately stored at -80\u00b0C until the enzymatic assay. After melting, the washed cell samples were haemolyzed with four times the cell volume of cold 1 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), vortex-mixed, and left to stand in an ice bath for 10 min, before centrifugation (20 min, 4 \u00b0C, 20,000 g) to separate MB-COMT from S-COMT.  The supernatant was used immediately for the measurement of soluble COMT enzyme activity.  In addition, an aliquot of the supernatant was diluted (1:100) with 0.9% NaCl and stored at -20 \u00b0C before measurement of the protein content. The COMT assay was performed essentially according to the  method of Schultz et al. with minor modifications.  The incubation mixture contained 300 \u03bcL enzyme  preparation, 375 \u03bcL incubation medium, and 75 \u03bcL 10 mM (final  concentration 1 mM) adrenaline as the enzyme substrate.  The final 750 \u03bcL reaction volume contained 100 mM sodium phosphate  buffer (pH 7.8), 2 mM MgCl2, and 200 \u03bcM S-adenosyl-L-methionine.  The samples were incubated in a water bath at 37 \u00b0C for 60 min. The tubes were transferred to ice, and the reaction was  stopped by adding 75 \u03bcL of ice-cold 2 M perchloric acid.  After 10 min, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4\u00b0C at 5400 g,  and 500 \u03bcL aliquots of the supernatant filtered on 0.22-\u03bcm pore  size Spin-X filter tubes (Costar) were used for the assay of metanephrine by means of high performance liquid chromatography  with electrochemical detection. S-COMT activity was expressed as the amount of metanephrine formed (in pmol) per mg of protein in the sample, per hour (pmol\/mg prot\/h), by the action of COMT on a single adrenaline concentration (1000 \u03bcM).","PMID":26773917},{"S-NO":230,"Group name":"Total ","Content":"Sociodemographic characteristics","Variable name":"Sex","Variable type":"Categorical","Classification":"Male","Statistical indicators":"n(%)","Value":"5 (19)","Unit":null,"S-Value":null,"Method":null,"PMID":26289604},{"S-NO":230,"Group name":"Total ","Content":"Sociodemographic characteristics","Variable name":"Sex","Variable type":"Categorical","Classification":"Female","Statistical indicators":"n(%)","Value":"21 (81)","Unit":null,"S-Value":"Female;Male","Method":null,"PMID":26289604},{"S-NO":230,"Group name":"Total ","Content":"Sociodemographic characteristics","Variable name":"Age","Variable type":"Categorical","Classification":"14 years","Statistical indicators":"n(%)","Value":"8 (31)","Unit":null,"S-Value":"14-17","Method":null,"PMID":26289604},{"S-NO":230,"Group name":"Total ","Content":"Sociodemographic characteristics","Variable name":"Age","Variable type":"Categorical","Classification":"15 years","Statistical indicators":"n(%)","Value":"5 (19)","Unit":null,"S-Value":null,"Method":null,"PMID":26289604},{"S-NO":230,"Group name":"Total ","Content":"Sociodemographic characteristics","Variable name":"Age","Variable type":"Categorical","Classification":"16 years","Statistical indicators":"n(%)","Value":"8 (31)","Unit":null,"S-Value":null,"Method":null,"PMID":26289604},{"S-NO":230,"Group name":"Total ","Content":"Sociodemographic characteristics","Variable name":"Age","Variable type":"Categorical","Classification":"17 years","Statistical indicators":"n(%)","Value":"5 (19)","Unit":null,"S-Value":null,"Method":null,"PMID":26289604},{"S-NO":230,"Group name":"Total ","Content":"Treatment","Variable name":"Counselling","Variable type":"Categorical","Classification":null,"Statistical indicators":"n(%)","Value":"10 (39)","Unit":null,"S-Value":null,"Method":null,"PMID":26289604},{"S-NO":230,"Group name":"Total ","Content":"Treatment","Variable name":"CBT","Variable type":"Categorical","Classification":null,"Statistical indicators":"n(%)","Value":"1 (4)","Unit":null,"S-Value":null,"Method":null,"PMID":26289604},{"S-NO":230,"Group name":"Total ","Content":"Treatment","Variable name":"Treated by CAMHS(Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service) but unknown modality","Variable type":"Categorical","Classification":null,"Statistical indicators":"n(%)","Value":"6 (19)","Unit":null,"S-Value":null,"Method":null,"PMID":26289604},{"S-NO":230,"Group name":"Total ","Content":"Treatment","Variable name":"No treatment\/waiting list","Variable type":"Categorical","Classification":null,"Statistical indicators":"n(%)","Value":"7 (7)","Unit":null,"S-Value":null,"Method":null,"PMID":26289604},{"S-NO":230,"Group name":"Total ","Content":"Treatment","Variable name":"Not reported","Variable type":"Categorical","Classification":null,"Statistical indicators":"n(%)","Value":"3 (12)","Unit":null,"S-Value":null,"Method":null,"PMID":26289604},{"S-NO":231,"Group name":"Total ","Content":"Cognitive function","Variable name":"Visual reaction time","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":null,"Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"244.64(156.38)","Unit":null,"S-Value":null,"Method":"Audiovisual reaction time was measured  using Fit Model No. OT 4000.

DAS consists of two parallel forms, each containing 40 clauses that the participants should comment on it based on the scale containing the complete agreement to complete disagreement. For grading DAS, scores from 1 (completely disagree) to 7 (totally agree) are utilized.  However, for number 2, 6, 12, 17, 24, 29, 30, 35, 37 and 40, the grading is vice versa in comparison to the other cases.  Therefore, the scores will theoretically range from a minimum of 40 to a maximum of 280. Beck et al. reported the reliability of 0.89 and more for the forms A and B. The correlation between the two tests was reported to be more than 0.81.  In a survey to obtain the reliability coefficient, this test was done and evaluated on 50 participants (18 females, 32 males, with ages ranging from 21 to 36, (SD=3.46 and M=25) from the Kurdistan Islamic Azad University in the city of Sanandaj.

Measurements were executed under a standardized protocol between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m. to avoid circadian influence in a quiet room with stable temperature (22-25\u00b0C).  Participants refrained from alcohol or caffeine ingestion for 24 hours preceding the study sessions.  Participants were asked to remain supine in a comfortable bed, without speaking or making any movements.  Subjects were asked to breathe following the rhythm of a metronome, the pace of which was maintained between 12 and 15 beats\/min according to the individual preference. During each trial we recorded ECG signal with Cardioline\u00ae click which was transmitted to the PC via the slim line. Resting heart rate was continuously monitored and recorded for 20 minutes as recommended by  Malik and colleagues. The R\u2013R intervals were visually inspected for artifacts, because HRV analysis can be considerably altered by frequent extrasystoles: parameters based on successive   differences are highly sensitive to ectopic activity.  Exclusion of the extrasystole and the following compensatory pause leads to reliable results.  Time domain indices and their unit of measure were:  RR interval (beats per minute), standard deviation of heart rate (SDHR, beats per minute), standard deviation of the NN interval (SDNN, ms), the square root of the mean squared differences of successive NN intervals (RMSSD, ms), the percentage of interval differences of successive NN intervals greater than 50 ms (pNN50, %). Spectral analysis for frequency domain indices were performed by fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and yielded indices of power density in the lowfrequency band (LF, 0.04- 0.15 Hz, ms2\/Hz), high-frequency band (HF, 0.15-0.40 Hz, ms2\/Hz) and low-frequency\/high-frequency ratio (LF\/HF). At study end, thirty participants took part to three   assessments of HRV, 40 to two assessments and 18 to one assessment, for a total of 188 HRV measurements.","PMID":27660194},{"S-NO":264,"Group

The EQ-5D-5 L comprises five questions on mobility, self-care, pain, usual activities, and psychological status. For each question there are 5 possible responses, ranging from best to worse. Responses were scored using the published \u2018cross walk\u2019 data set. Possible scores for the EQ-5D-5 L range from 1 to \u22120.594. On this scale 1 is considered equal to full health and 0 is equal to death. The scoring system allows for some health states to be considered \u2018worse than death\u2019. As the EQ-5D-5 L is comparatively new the body of literature on its use is developing. However, there is evidence supporting the use in depression of the EQ-5D-3 L (3-level where each question has 3 possible answers). The EQ-5D-3 L was found to be responsive to changes in depression, and mean EQ-5D-3 L scores have significantly correlated with a number of clinical outcome measures relating to major depression in

disturbance, sadness, shortness of breath, difficulty remembering, poor appetite, drowsiness, dry mouth, distress, vomiting and numbness that were assessed using the Taiwanese version of the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI-T). MDASI-T comprises 13 single-item measures of symptom intensity in the past 24\u2009h, each of which is scored on an 11-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine). The symptom severity score was an average of these 13 symptom items: higher scores indicated greater symptom intensity. The questionnaire was validated for a sample of Taiwanese patients with cancer, which exhibited a strong Cronbach's \u03b1, with an internal consistency of 0.89 and a test\u2013retest reliability of 0.97. The MDASI-T scale is a reliable tool and has been used to assess Taiwanese patients with cancer.","PMID":25490525},{"S-NO":276,"Group name":"Exercise","Content":"Sociodemographic

We conducted the test on a tartan track at a local Sports Club.  Participants walked for 2 kilometres with the instruction to walk as fast as possible, but not run.  A participants\u201f heart rate was continuously measured using commercially available sports watches (Polar\u00a9  RS800CX, Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland).  Lap time and total walking time were documented. An estimate of the maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) was then calculated   using recorded lap time, body mass index (BMI), heart rate (during last 30 seconds of walking), age and gender. This estimation is considered to be reasonably accurate. From the same parameters, we derived the Fitness Index (FI) as a measure of  physical fitness.  A FI smaller than 70 indicates \u201cconsiderably below average\u201d, between 70 and 89 \u201csomewhat below average\u201d physical fitness.  FI scores between 90 and 110 are considered \u201caverage\u201d, between 111 and 130 \u201csomewhat above average\u201d larger than 130  \u201cconsiderably above average\u201d.

The BFI  assesses fatigue-related psychological distress and mood disturbances, fatigue severity, and fatigue impact on daily functions during the most recent 24-hour period.  The nine items  in the inventory include three addressing severity and six addressing impact.  Items are scored on an 11-point (points 0-10) Likert scale, with higher values indicating higher fatigue and  greater impact of fatigue on daily life.  Internal consistency  has been indicated by Cronbach\u2019s alphas of .96 for fatiguerelated severity and .95 for interference.  Test-retest reliability  was .89 for fatigue severity and .91 for interference.

Morale is often used synonymously with psychological or subjective well-being, and the PGCMS has been  recommended for assessment of subjective well-being  by the British Geriatrics Society and the Royal College of Physicians of London.

were obtained by both time-domain and frequency-domain analyses of 24-h continuous  ambulatory ECG recordings, through a three-channel Digital Ambulatory ECG Holter Recorder with electronic RAM memory, at the beginning  and at the end of the study on a non-HD day. The WinTer Holter Analyzer software (GBI-3S), which has  been tested and recognized by the FDA, was used for the  analysis. Moreover, postprocessing was used to remove  ectopic discharges from RR analysis, as only normal-tonormal RR intervals were used in the analysis of HRV  indices. The participants were asked to avoid caffeine  and alcoholic beverages, as well as any activity that could  affect the heart rhythm, except for their daily activities,  during the recording, to keep heart rate modulations as  stable as possible, for a more accurate interpretation of  the results of the frequency-domain analysis.

From the frequency-domain  analysis performed on the entire 24 h period, the  following indices were evaluated: low frequency (LF, frequencies with range 0.04\u20130.15 Hz) and high frequency (HF, frequencies with range 0.15\u20130.4 Hz) components,  as well as the LF\/HF ratio.

It is an abbreviated version of the WHOQOL-100 quality of life instrument, developed by the WHOQOL group. The WHOQOL Bref adopts the following definition of health-related quality of life: \"the value assigned to duration of life as modified by the impairments, functional states, perceptions, and social opportunities that are influenced by disease, injury, treatment, or policy\". This instrument is being field-tested at present and, according to the WHOQOL group provides an adequate alternative to the WHOQOL-100. It produces scores for four domains related to quality of life (physical health, psychological, social relationships and environment). The Italian version used in the present study has also been reported to have satisfactory psychometric properties. The items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale, reflecting intensity, capacity, frequency or evaluation. The items inquire \"how much,\" \"how completely,\" \"how often,\" \"how good\" or \"how satisfied,\" with possible answers ranging, from very satisfied to not at all satisfied. The range of scores in each domain is from 4 to 20, where a higher score indicates a better quality of life.","PMID":18221549},{"S-NO":410,"Group name":"Exercise","Content":"Sociodemographic characteristics","Variable name":"Age","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":null,"Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"34.33 (3.36)","Unit":"years","S-Value":"30.97-37.69","Method":null,"PMID":18373127},{"S-NO":410,"Group name":"Exercise","Content":"Sociodemographic characteristics","Variable name":"Sex","Variable type":"Categorical","Classification":"Female","Statistical indicators":"n","Value":100,"Unit":"%","S-Value":"Female","Method":null,"PMID":18373127},{"S-NO":410,"Group name":"Exercise","Content":"Sociodemographic characteristics","Variable name":"Education level","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":null,"Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"16.04 (1.71)","Unit":"years","S-Value":null,"Method":null,"PMID":18373127},{"S-NO":410,"Group name":"Exercise","Content":"Sociodemographic characteristics","Variable name":"Income ","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":null,"Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"5.25 (1.27)","Unit":null,"S-Value":null,"Method":"Income scale 1\u20136, e.g., 4\u2009=\u2009$30,000\u2013$40,000; 5\u2009=\u2009$40, 000\u2013$50,000.","PMID":18373127},{"S-NO":410,"Group name":"Exercise","Content":"Sociodemographic characteristics","Variable name":"Years with current partner","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":null,"Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"7.30 (4.02)","Unit":"years","S-Value":null,"Method":null,"PMID":18373127},{"S-NO":410,"Group name":"Exercise","Content":"Obstetric characteristics","Variable name":"Primiparous","Variable type":"Categorical","Classification":null,"Statistical indicators":"n","Value":41.3,"Unit":"%","S-Value":null,"Method":null,"PMID":18373127},{"S-NO":410,"Group name":"Exercise","Content":"Obstetric characteristics","Variable name":"Cesarean Delivery","Variable type":"Categorical","Classification":null,"Statistical indicators":"n","Value":32.6,"Unit":"%","S-Value":null,"Method":null,"PMID":18373127},{"S-NO":410,"Group name":"Exercise","Content":"Obstetric characteristics","Variable name":"Weeks since delivery","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":null,"Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"10.96 (7.22)","Unit":"weeks","S-Value":null,"Method":null,"PMID":18373127},{"S-NO":410,"Group name":"Exercise","Content":"Anthropometry","Variable name":"BMI","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":null,"Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"27.08 (5.67)","Unit":"kg\/m2","S-Value":"21.41-32.75","Method":null,"PMID":18373127},{"S-NO":410,"Group name":"Exercise","Content":"Quality of life","Variable name":"Physical Fatigue","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":null,"Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"14.70 (3.23)","Unit":"scores","S-Value":null,"Method":"The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) is a self-report instrument developed to assess the various components of fatigue.

There are three subscales in FSC, include a 10-item physical fatigue subscale (items 0-10), 10-item psychological fatigue subscale (items 11-20), and 10-item fatigue symptom subscale (items 21-30).
