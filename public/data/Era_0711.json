The Lovett test is currently the most common method of subjective muscle strength assessment. It involves the palpation of individual muscles in certain body positions and movement. In every movement, there is one main muscle that is responsible for movement. Due to the appropriate position, it is isolated from other synergistic muscles. According to Lovett, the following levels of muscle strength are distinguished: 0, no active muscle contraction; 1, a trace of active muscle contraction; 2, a clear muscle contraction and the ability to move and relieve mobility in a section; 3, the ability to move independently active with overcoming the weight of a given section; 4, the ability to perform active movement with some resistance; 5, correct force, i.e., the ability to perform active movement with full resistance. This scale can be expressed as a percentage, then: 0 = 0%, 1 = 10%, 2 = 25%, 3 = 50%, 4 = 75%, 5 = 100%. For a more accurate assessment of muscle strength, the intermediate steps 2+, 3 are used when strength is rated above 1\u00b0 and below the next step.

Thereafter, a subject was asked to maintain a constant cycling speed of 60 rev.\/min. The initial work rate was 300 kg\u00d7 m\/min and it was increased by 150 kg \u00d7 m\/min every 3 min. The pedaling stopped after reaching the upper threshold corresponding to the submaximal level of leg work. This threshold was determined individually as the exercise intensity requiring 75-80% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate. The sum of physical work made at different work rates over the testing period was used as an index of physical work capacity.","PMID":10788675},{"S-NO":462,"Exercise risk evaluation":"Symptom-limited graded exercise treadmill test","Method":null,"PMID":10718684},{"S-NO":463,"Exercise risk evaluation":"Cardiopulmonary exercise test","Method":"At baseline and at the conclusion of 4 months of treatment, participants underwent a symptom-limited graded exercise treadmill test under continuous electrocardiographic recording. A modified Balke protocol was used in which workloads were increased at a rate of 1 metabolic equivalent per minute.  Expired air was collected by mouthpiece for quantification of minute ventilation, oxygen consumption, and carbon dioxide production.  Samples were collected at 15-second intervals, and peak values were determined from an average obtained during the last 60 seconds.

All subjects who completed an asymptomatic graded exercise test were given a prescription for involvement in aerobic exercise training; whereas subjects whose graded exercise test indicated cardiovascular abnormalities were referred to their family physician for further medical evaluation. Aerobic fitness was assessed for all subjects (ie, exercise and control) via VO2peak measures attained during a physician-monitored graded exercise test.  A Schwinn Air-Dyne cycle ergometer was used that functions on the basis of airdisplacement resistance such that the higher the revolutions per minute (RPM), the higher the work rate achieved. The   ergometer allows for use of any combination of limbs and was modified to allow for testing from a seated position in a wheelchair. Heart rates and blood pressures were monitored throughout exercise and recovery periods.  Respiratory gases were continuously sampled and analyzed every 30 seconds throughout the exercise portion of the test by means of an indirect calorimetry system using a Beckman Metabolic Cart. In an attempt to minimize early termination of   the exercise test owing to local muscular fatigue, a discontinuous, progressive protocol of 2 minutes of exercise followed by 2 minutes of rest was employed.  Similar work rate increments were employed with all subjects;  initial work rates were determined by the amount of functional muscle mass available for exercising. VO2peak was measured at the point of peak volitional fatigue or symptom limitation.","PMID":7605184},{"S-NO":469,"Exercise risk evaluation":"Medical clearance","Method":"Clients whose health status was judged to be satisfactory based on medical records, evaluations of registered nurses, and a physical examination by a physician were given the opportunity to volunteer to participate in the study.","PMID":7675585},{"S-NO":469,"Exercise risk evaluation":"Kasch step test","Method":"Kasch Step Test.
