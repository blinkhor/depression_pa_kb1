Each training session started with 5 min warm-up using brisk walking, followed by two rounds of 10 exercises, each performed for 20 s and followed by 10 s of rest, following the timing ratio of Tabata et al. Previous research showed that short rest between exercise bouts is associated with maximized metabolic impact.The protocol focused on training using body weight (no equipment needed) and aimed to incorporate a combination of aerobic exercises, strengthening exercises for the upper and lower body, and core stability exercises for beginners. In brief, the selected ten exercises are: (1) jumping jack, (2) wall sit, (3) pushup, (4) abdominal crunch, (5) squat, (6) plank, (7) lunge, (8)side plank (right side), (9) side plank (left side), and (10) high knees running. The selected exercises included in our program showed accessibility, practicality, and time-saving for individuals previously felt they did not have enough resources or time to exercise. Participants were encouraged to stay hydrated between the two rounds by offering 100 mL (3.3 oz) of water. An exercise program should be performed three times a week for at least 8 weeks, to have effective results in depressive symptoms in adults. Thus, the sessions were delivered over 8 weeks (three times per week) in the rehabilitation services department of the psychiatric hospital, Bahrain. Interventions were delivered in small groups of about four patients, selected merely based on sex. In cases of absence, patients were contacted by phone and scheduled to make up any missed session or offered a remote session over the telephone. We planned that patients who missed a total of fve sessions or three consecutive ses sions would be excluded from the study but no patient met this criterion.","PMID":34046817,"Scores":85},{"ProtocolNumber":3,"ProtocolName":"Low-intensity and low-frequency exercise","Classification":"Aerobic exercise;Resistance exercise","Frequency":1,"Intensity ":"Light","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"RPE(10\u201313)\/(Borg 6-20);%HRmax(\uff1c59)","TimesPerSession":45,"Type":"High leg running;Small step running;Lunges;Skipping rope;;Planks;Sit-ups;Push-ups;Elastic band exercises","Volume":60,"PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"10min","CoolDown":"5min","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"6 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"NA","ExerciseContraindications":"Physical illnesses; Suffered serious physical injuries (such as fractures) within one year; Severe mental illness diseases (psychosis); Assessed by the Health Guidance Center as unsuitable to participate in the experiment.

In physical and control interventions we promoted a task-oriented and enjoyable environment, with highly varied interventions oriented towards the individuals\u2019 integrity and security, and with a learning component to encourage adaptive behaviors, healthy habits, and autonomous motivation to practice group activities. The wishes of the patients were taken into account to adapt the sessions so as to maintain compliance in the protocol. The heart rate was monitored in each participant with an individual POLAR FT2\u00ae heart rate monitor to measure the intensity of activity. The therapists were exercise professionals, physical health caregivers, physical education teachers and physiotherapists. They managed in alternation the same number of sessions in each group. Both interventions consisted of 20 sessions of 1 hour each (50 minutes activity + 10 minutes for gathering equipment, warm-up and cool-down), each administered three to four times a week for a duration of five to six weeks to complete the program (total = 20 hours).The physical exercise intervention was conducted with moderate physical intensity and supervised by exercise specialists. The target heart rate during exercise was 40 to 59% of Heart Rate Reserve (HRR), which is an indicator of moderate intensity exercise. Each session started with a warm-up and ended with muscle stretching. Sessions entailed aerobic group games (basketball, ultimate frisbee, football, unihoc (floorball), volleyball, novel games (kinball, tchoukball) and muscular strengthening (using own body weight and weight machines). We also proposed racket sports (tennis, badminton, table tennis), biking sessions, and indoor wall climbing. On average, 80% of the sessions were focused on cardiovascular training with moderate physical intensity, and the remaining 20% devoted to muscle strengthening.

A physiotherapist certified in NW (by the World Gymstick Team) instructed patients on the proper use of walking poles (Gymstick International Oy, Lahti, Finland) and basic NW techniques. NW was performed on an indoor track, and also encouraged in other indoor and outdoor venues, space permitting, as part of the home exercise guidelines. NW and MICT patients were instructed to keep their HRs within resting HR + 20-40 bpm and encouraged to attain an Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) of 12 to 16 (somewhat hard to hard). This is standard practice at the UOHI and these methods have been published elsewhere.HRs were monitored using Polar HR monitors, their own devices (e.g. Apple watch) or manual palpation. For the latter, patients palpated their radial pulse for 10 s and multiplied by 6 to compute their exercise HR in bpm at rest and after the 30 min of the continuous aerobic conditioning portion of the sessions.

Agility is the ability to change the position and direction of the body in a rapid and efficient way. For this, the participants have been guided to perform the Seogi moves (Several postures where one stands on both feet to control the distance from the opponent or to perform techniques) of Taekwondo, including Juchumseogi (the posture of both legs standing as if they were a little sitting), Apseogi (the posture of taking a step forward and putting the center of gravity in the middle), Apgubi (the posture of taking a step forward with one\u2019s center of gravity in front), and Dwitgubi (the posture of taking a step back and putting the center of gravity in the back). Upon instruction, the participants performed the motion to change direction (front, back, left, right) while standing with their feet apart in a straight or slightly diagonal line. The participants were also instructed to perform the Makgi moves, (technique of blocking an opponent\u2019s attack with arms), including Naeryeomakgi (technique of any downward cover using the wrist to block the opponent\u2019s attack on the lower part of the body such as abdomen or balls), Momtongmakgi (act of middle blocking nad deflecting away from the attacker by starting up the opposite shoulder and projecting the wrist down and across the body), and Ollyeomakgi (any cover of getting the wrist from down to up against the attack on the face), in which they rapidly rotate their wrists but control them precisely at a target position, to maintain body control and complete the move within a short time. Equilibrium was based on the Balchagi moves (technique of striking the target by kicking or spinning kicks), including Apchagi (technique of raising the knee to the waist, pulling the toes back and quickly extending the foot at the target right in front), Dollyeochagi (technique of turning the leg as well as waist and kicking the target from the outside toward the inside using the top of the foot), and Naeryeochagi (technique of kicking the face or chest of the opponent downward from above using the sole of the foot or bottom of the heel), in which the participants kicked with one leg while maintaining their balance with the other in a repeated manner to enhance the effects of dynamic balance.Coordination is the ability to integrate two or more movements for accurate, smooth, and harmonious balance of body motion. For this, the participants performed the chapter one of Taegeuk 1 Jang based on the primary moves (Seogi, Makgi, Balchagi, Jireugi) of Taekwondo and the Taekwon Aerobics to the music in the order of the set movements, whereby the participants learned the movements in various forms.For power and speed, the participants performed the Balchagi moves, including Apchagi, Dollyeochagi, and Naeryeochagi, following the instructor\u2019s command, in a direction to\u2014hit a target position to stimulate the quadriceps and the hip muscle.In particular Reaction time and speed measure the ability to rapidly thrust the body forward, which contributes to the development of the nervous system. Thus, to promote nervous system development and to improve the speed and reaction time, the participants were instructed to perform the Jireugi moves(techniques that strike or punch the target to give an impact on it whether it is a person or an object) including Momtongjireugi(a fist strike aimed at the mid-section of the opponent by extending the arm straight using the turning force of the body), Ulgooljireugi(a fist strike aimed at the face of the opponent by extending the arm straight using the turning force of the body), Naeryeojireugi(a fist strike aimed at the lower chest of the opponent by extending the arm straight using the turning force of the body), and Yeopjireugi(striking technique that punches from the side using the turning force of the body), while reacting as rapidly as possible to the instructor\u2019s whistle and to control their movements thereafter.Warm-up and cool-down exercises were comprised of stretches, memory recall, and connecting words in pairs.The Taekwondo training program is presented follow.

Equilibrium was based on the Balchagi moves (technique of striking the target by kicking or spinning kicks), including Apchagi (technique of raising the knee to the waist, pulling the toes back and quickly extending the foot at the target right in front), Dollyeochagi (technique of turning the leg as well as waist and kicking the target from the outside toward the inside using the top of the foot), and Naeryeochagi (technique of kicking the face or chest of the opponent downward from above using the sole of the foot or bottom of the heel), in which the participants kicked with one leg while maintaining their balance with the other in a repeated manner to enhance the effects of dynamic balance.Coordination is the ability to integrate two or more movements for accurate, smooth, and harmonious balance of body motion. For this, the participants performed the chapter one of Taegeuk 1 Jang based on the primary moves (Seogi, Makgi, Balchagi, Jireugi) of Taekwondo and the Taekwon Aerobics to the music in the order of the set movements, whereby the participants learned the movements in various forms.For power and speed, the participants performed the Balchagi moves, including Apchagi, Dollyeochagi, and Naeryeochagi, following the instructor\u2019s command, in a direction to\u2014hit a target position to stimulate the quadriceps and the hip muscle.In particular Reaction time and speed measure the ability to rapidly thrust the body forward, which contributes to the development of the nervous system. Thus, to promote nervous system development and to improve the speed and reaction time, the participants were instructed to perform the Jireugi moves(techniques that strike or punch the target to give an impact on it whether it is a person or an object) including Momtongjireugi(a fist strike aimed at the mid-section of the opponent by extending the arm straight using the turning force of the body), Ulgooljireugi(a fist strike aimed at the face of the opponent by extending the arm straight using the turning force of the body), Naeryeojireugi(a fist strike aimed at the lower chest of the opponent by extending the arm straight using the turning force of the body), and Yeopjireugi(striking technique that punches from the side using the turning force of the body), while reacting as rapidly as possible to the instructor\u2019s whistle and to control their movements thereafter.Warm-up and cool-down exercises were comprised of stretches, memory recall, and connecting words in pairs.The Taekwondo training program is presented follow.

Agility is the ability to change the position and direction of the body in a rapid and efficient way. For this, the participants have been guided to perform the Seogi moves (Several postures where one stands on both feet to control the distance from the opponent or to perform techniques) of Taekwondo, including Juchumseogi (the posture of both legs standing as if they were a little sitting), Apseogi (the posture of taking a step forward and putting the center of gravity in the middle), Apgubi (the posture of taking a step forward with one\u2019s center of gravity in front), and Dwitgubi (the posture of taking a step back and putting the center of gravity in the back). Upon instruction, the participants performed the motion to change direction (front, back, left, right) while standing with their feet apart in a straight or slightly diagonal line. The participants were also instructed to perform the Makgi moves, (technique of blocking an opponent\u2019s attack with arms), including Naeryeomakgi (technique of any downward cover using the wrist to block the opponent\u2019s attack on the lower part of the body such as abdomen or balls), Momtongmakgi (act of middle blocking nad deflecting away from the attacker by starting up the opposite shoulder and projecting the wrist down and across the body), and Ollyeomakgi (any cover of getting the wrist from down to up against the attack on the face), in which they rapidly rotate their wrists but control them precisely at a target position, to maintain body control and complete the move within a short time. Equilibrium was based on the Balchagi moves (technique of striking the target by kicking or spinning kicks), including Apchagi (technique of raising the knee to the waist, pulling the toes back and quickly extending the foot at the target right in front), Dollyeochagi (technique of turning the leg as well as waist and kicking the target from the outside toward the inside using the top of the foot), and Naeryeochagi (technique of kicking the face or chest of the opponent downward from above using the sole of the foot or bottom of the heel), in which the participants kicked with one leg while maintaining their balance with the other in a repeated manner to enhance the effects of dynamic balance.Coordination is the ability to integrate two or more movements for accurate, smooth, and harmonious balance of body motion. For this, the participants performed the chapter one of Taegeuk 1 Jang based on the primary moves (Seogi, Makgi, Balchagi, Jireugi) of Taekwondo and the Taekwon Aerobics to the music in the order of the set movements, whereby the participants learned the movements in various forms.For power and speed, the participants performed the Balchagi moves, including Apchagi, Dollyeochagi, and Naeryeochagi, following the instructor\u2019s command, in a direction to\u2014hit a target position to stimulate the quadriceps and the hip muscle.In particular Reaction time and speed measure the ability to rapidly thrust the body forward, which contributes to the development of the nervous system.

During exercise, patients imitated the specific movements and respiration patterns of monkeys. The training scheme was consistent with guidelines recommended by the Chinese Health-Qigong Association.The entire process consisted of the following three steps: commencing form, monkey exercise,and closing position. Performing the commencing position prepares the body for exercise by regulating breathing to a uniform frequency with the mind concentrating on Dantian to reach a quiet and tranquil mental state. The closing position of exercise is designed to induce Qi to Dantian.Monkey exercise is composed of two motions: monkey lifting and monkey picking. Monkey lifting includes four sections: (1) extend both hands forward, extend all 10 fingers and separate them from one another, then bend the wrists and collect the fingers together forming \u2018\u2018monkey\u2019s hooked paws\u2019\u2019; (2) lift both hands to chest level, shrug the shoulders, clamp arms, erect waist, contract abdomen, and clench anus, meanwhile, lift heels and turn head to the left,and look directly to the left; (3) turn head to the front position and relax shoulders, arms, abdomen, and anus, change the form of the hands from \u2018\u2018monkey\u2019s hooked paws\u2019\u2019 to palms with fingertips facing each other and palms downward;and (4) relax the arms and place palms down at the sides of body, put heels back with soles on the ground. Then repeat the motions above with head turning to the right side.All lifting actions should be done twice. Monkey picking includes five sections: (1) bend right leg and shift body weight to right leg while moving left foot backward with tiptoes turning outward about 45\u00b0 and touching the ground.Meanwhile, bend the left elbow and form a \u2018\u2018monkey\u2019s hooked paw\u2019\u2019 with the Hegu point touching the waist while stretching right arm to front right side of body with palm down; (2) shift body weight to left leg with sole on the ground while taking right foot in to the inner side of left foot with front sole touching the ground forming a right T-stance, meanwhile, turn body left, move right arm to the left side of head with palm facing the left temple; (3) turn right hand and press it to the left side of hips, eyes on the right palm; (4) move right foot forward about 45\u00b0 and shift body weight to the right leg, straighten right knee while pulling left leg in and straightening left knee with tiptoes touching the ground; meanwhile, move right palm up in an arc line to the right ear with wrist erect and \u2018\u2018monkey\u2019s hooked paw\u2019\u2019 formed with right hand, slightly higher than the shoulders; straighten left arm and turn \u2018\u2018monkey\u2019s hooked paw\u2019\u2019 into palm, and move it from backward to upward and forward with wrist erected and fingertips together as if a monkey was picking fruits from a tree; and (5)turn \u2018\u2018monkey\u2019s hooked paw\u2019\u2019 into a solid fist with left hand,shift body weight to leg while taking the right foot in to the side of left foot with tiptoes touching the ground to make a right T-stance; meanwhile, sink shoulder and bend elbow with left arm and move it to the left shoulder with palm facing upward and fingers separated like holding a peach while moving right palm in an arc line past the front of the body to just below the left elbow. Then repeat the motions above, but reverse left and right.

Patients were asked to perform five 15\u201318-min exercise sessions per week between 15:00 and 16:00 h each day.Participants were asked to observe several key points before and after training: (1) empty bowels before exercise;(2) control food intake to avoid excess hunger or fullness during exercise; (3) drink a proper amount of warm boiled water to facilitate movement of Qi and blood; and (4) do not bathe in cold water after exercise.","PMID":33979535,"Scores":70},{"ProtocolNumber":43,"ProtocolName":"Hatha yoga ","Classification":"Yoga","Frequency":1,"Intensity ":"NA","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"NA","TimesPerSession":75,"Type":"Poses;Meditation;Breathing;Relaxation[Svasana relaxation and breathing exercises;Knee to chest;Knee together twist;Pelvic tilt;Cat and cow pose (and modifications);Chair pose (and modifications);Shoulder opener;Crescent moon (and modifications);Mountain pose (and modifications);Chair twists, standing and seated;Child\u2019s pose;Cobra (and modifications);Bridge pose(with and without support);Reclining cobbler;Downward facing dog (and at wall);Triangle pose (with and without the wall);Locust pose;Sphinx;Standing forward bend at wall;Warrior pose;Extended leg pose;Sun salutations;Baby dancer pose;Spinal rolls;Svasana integrative relaxation]","Volume":75,"PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"NA","CoolDown":"NA","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"52 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Specific causes of LBP(low back pain) including spinal canal stenosis, >Grade I spondylolisthesis, ankylosing spondylitis, moderate to severe scoliosis, malignancy, and fracture;New cLBP(chronic low back pain) treatment(s) started within the previous month or anticipated to begin in the next 3 months;Previous back surgery;Severe or progressive neurological deficits;Sciatica pain equal to or greater than back pain;Active or recent cervical radiculopathy;Active or planned worker\u2019s compensation, disability, or personal injury claims;Perceived religious conflict;Any severe psychiatric or medical comorbidity that in the judgment of the PI(principal investigator) would make participation unsafe or not possible.","CombinationTherapy":"World music;Home practice","Protocol":"The manualized hatha yoga intervention consisted of 12 weekly 75-minute classes that included poses, meditation, breathing, and relaxation was refined from previous studies. Each class begins with svasana (a relaxation exercise), yoga breathing exercises (pranayama), and a brief discussion of yoga philosophy:check in with participants(3min);lesson introduction and yoga philosophy(3min);relaxation exercise(3min);breathing exercise(4min);yoga postures(55min);closing relaxation(5min);closing(2min).The class proceeds with yoga postures (asanas). Yoga breathing is emphasized throughout. The class ends with svasana. The 12 weeks are divided into four 3-week segments. Each segment is given a theme (e.g., \u201cListening to the Wisdom of the Body\u201d). Participants are frequently advised to go slowly and carefully. The degree of difficulty of postures learned increases with each segment. For each segment, the participants gradually learn a sequence of 15\u201319 poses. The protocol provides variations and uses various aids (e.g., chair, yoga strap, yoga block) to accommodate a range of physical abilities. A variety of world music is used during the classes. Participants are strongly encouraged to do yoga home-practice for 30 minutes daily on days which they do not attend yoga class. To facilitate home practice, participants receive a DVD of the protocol, a guidebook describing and depicting the protocol, and a yoga mat, strap, and block.Classes usually have 1\u20133 yoga teachers and no more than 4\u20135 participants per yoga teacher. This ensures adequate individual attention from the teacher, maximizes safety and effectiveness, and allows flexibility in yoga teacher scheduling based on the study\u2019s needs. In the event that only one or two participants appear for a given class, the class still occurs and is not cancelled. In the event of unusual or extenuating circumstances (e.g., a participant misses multiple classes due to an emergency), we may attempt to set up a special make-up individual class so the participant can \u201ccatch up\u201d and successfully rejoin his or her group class as soon as possible. However, these are rare; one-on-one instruction in the yoga group is not planned or routine.All yoga teachers undergo a 12-hour training on the protocol delivered by a senior yoga instructor. All teachers receive and follow a yoga instructor manual. A senior yoga instructor or the PI observe a sample of yoga classes and assure the protocol is appropriately being implemented using a checklist. Audits occur on 10% of yoga classes in each cohort. After 12 weeks, participants who attended at least one PT(physical therapy) or yoga session were included in the 40-week maintenance phase. In the yoga group, participants were re-randomized to either a weekly drop-in yoga class or home practice only, and in the PT group to either five \u201cbooster sessions\u201d or home practice only.","PMID":33556352,"Scores":50},{"ProtocolNumber":44,"ProtocolName":"Physical therapy","Classification":"Resistance exercise;Aerobic exercise","Frequency":"NA","Intensity ":"NA","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"NA","TimesPerSession":60,"Type":"Abdominal bracing;Bracing with heel slides;Bracing with leg lifts;Bracing with bridging;Bracing with standing;Bracing with standing row exercise;Bracing with walking;Quadraped arm lifts with bracing;Quadraped leg lifts with bracing;Quadraped alternative arm & leg lifts w\/ bracing;Side support with knees flexed;Side support with knees extended;Side support with knees flexed;Side support with knees extended","Volume":"NA","PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"NA","CoolDown":"NA","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"YES","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"52 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Specific causes of LBP(low back pain) including spinal canal stenosis, >Grade I spondylolisthesis, ankylosing spondylitis, moderate to severe scoliosis, malignancy, and fracture;New cLBP(chronic low back pain) treatment(s) started within the previous month or anticipated to begin in the next 3 months;Previous back surgery;Severe or progressive neurological deficits;Sciatica pain equal to or greater than back pain;Active or recent cervical radiculopathy;Active or planned worker\u2019s compensation, disability, or personal injury claims;Perceived religious conflict;Any severe psychiatric or medical comorbidity that in the judgment of the PI(principal investigator) would make participation unsafe or not possible.","CombinationTherapy":"Home practice","Protocol":"The physical therapy(PT) intervention utilized a treatment-based classification system to guide selection of a program of graded exercise during 15 visits.

The goal of the exercise intervention was for participants to engage in exercise five days per week for at least 30\u2009min per session. Exercise was defined as any activity lasting at least 10\u2009min that was in the moderate or vigorous intensity range. Participants were taught how to take their heart rate and told to keep their heart rate in the moderate (55\u201370% of heart rate maximum which is estimated at 220 minus their age) or vigorous intensity range (70\u201385% of maximum heart rate). They were also told that the exercise sessions should be at least 10\u2009min in length (could do three separate sessions in one day to obtain the 30\u2009min recommendation) and feel at least like a brisk walk. To examine the success of the independent variable manipulation, exercise was assessed at 6 and 9\u2009months following randomization using the 7-Day Physical Activity Interview (PAR) and ActiGraph. The PAR is a semi-structured interview that assesses exercise over the previous seven days, which has been shown to be reliable and valid with postpartum women.

","CombinationTherapy":"Psychotropic medications ","Protocol":"The yoga protocol was developed specifically for this study and in consultation with a Centre of Excellence for Yoga at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bangalore, India. Based on published evidence, the manualized yoga practice focused on cyclical breathing and breathe control (pranayamas) as the key component of the yoga protocol. These breathing practices included Ujjayi and Kapalabhati techniques. Cyclical breathing refers to rapid cycle breathing where individuals begin by breathing 40 to 60 breaths per minute, followed by 60 to 80 breaths per minute, and finish with 80 to 100 breaths per minute. This is repeated 3 times to complete 1 round. A full cyclical breathing program consists of 5 rounds. In the study protocol, participants gradually worked their way up to 5 rounds. Other components of the yoga intervention included postures and guided meditation that allowed some flexibility for participants with different ability levels to acquire the yoga technique. The yoga protocol was standardized for subjects to learn the practice in the same regulated sequence and pace to maintain fidelity of practice and taught by an instructor trained in Bangalore, India. When necessary, minor modifications were allowed to accommodate varying physical abilities. Treatment sessions were conducted twice a week for 1.5 hours per session. Participants were also encouraged to practice at home and to document it. During the study, psychotropic medications were permitted; however, only patients who were on stable doses for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization were included and no increases in psychotropic medications were allowed.

Coordination exercises included, for example, standing on even or uneven ground with eyes open or closed (balance), sitting on a chair while lifting one's toes or heels and throwing and catching a ball at the same time (dual task). Resistance exercises were, for example, wall pushups, holding medicine balls with outstretched arms, squats, or crunches. Exercise intensity was monitored using Borg's Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale (RPE), which is a scale from 6 (\u201cno exertion\u201d) to 20 (\u201cmaximal exertion\u201d).

Moreover, this Tai Chi protocol has been used for over 10 years to instruct community-dwelling older adults with\/without chronic illness, without safety issues or adverse events. Ms. Edna Silva, RN, an experienced Tai Chi Instructor (>25 years) provided the Tai Chi instruction in this study. The Tai Chi protocol included correct body preparation, standing meditation, and 24 basic movements. Participants were gradually taught the 24 basic movements from the Classic Wu style of Tai Chi (average two new movements per week). Weight shifting was incorporated into all movements, containing one or more of the five basic stances: (a) parallel (i.e., stand with feet hip width apart), (b) empty (i.e., step forward with one foot placing no weight on it), (c) T-step (i.e., turning one foot inward 45\u201360\u00b0), (d) horse riding (i.e., stand with feet double width of parallel step), and (e) archery (i.e., step forward with one foot, front leg bent with rear leg straight). During class, participants were asked to replicate the motions, postures, and movement speed of the Tai Chi Instructor. Each movement was broken into its components and practiced in many ways (e.g., using just legs, then just arms, and finally arms and legs together). Each session consisted of a 10-minute warm-up period, 40-minute Tai Chi exercise, and a 10-minute cool-down period. All classes were held at a community-based exercise facility with accessible parking. Each class began with a review of prior content. Participants were standing during classes, but chairs were set up to allow for brief rest periods. Participants were monitored closely for safety (e.g., foot placement) during the class by the Tai Chi Instructor and study staff. Intervention delivery was guided by Self-Determination Theory (SDT), such as allowing participants to make their own decisions and express ideas\/opinions (autonomy), learn new skills and instill a sense of accomplishment (competence), and interact with others to create\/build meaningful connections (relatedness). This was accomplished by using noncontrolling language and providing information, encouragement, and feedback within a supportive environment. In addition, the 8 \u201cactive ingredients\u201d of Tai Chi as outlined in the Harvard Medical School Guide to Tai Chi were incorporated during class. For example, the instructor describes\/corrects the Tai Chi movements to ensure structural integration\/correct body posture. In this study, we refined the Tai Chi intervention based on participant feedback and added a brief (5-minute) \u201ccircle sharing session\u201d after each class, to allow each person to share how they were feeling, provide comments or ask questions. Each person had the opportunity to share or \u201cpass,\u201d if they wanted. No movements were modified, though due to COVID-19, the Human Subjects Protection Program required us to end the Tai Chi intervention after 8 weeks, instead of the planned 12 weeks.","PMID":34765010,"Scores":65},{"ProtocolNumber":75,"ProtocolName":"Tai Chi","Classification":"Tai Chi","Frequency":3,"Intensity ":"NA","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"NA","TimesPerSession":55,"Type":"NA","Volume":180,"PeriodsOfTime":"07:00-08:00","WarmUp":"Yes","CoolDown":"Yes","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"24 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Movement disorders;Obvious joint injuries;Cardiovascular diseases.

These three exercise sessions were repeated every week. The PA program aimed to increase motivation for and to induce a positive affective response towards physical and sportive activity. It mainly consisted of interactive games, which the patients had to perform within the group or with one patient as partner. This approach reduced competitiveness among participants which could trigger a sense of underachievement or failure, or could invoke negative prior experiences (e.g., with PA at school). In addition, each PA session started with a 10-min warm-up which combined physical and cognitive tasks, by coding certain movements (e.g., circling of arms, lifting knees up) with colors (colored cards held up by the instructor). During the warm-up participants walked briskly through the room and had to perform the required movement (once) when the instructor showed the respective colored card. The color-movement associations were changed randomly in every PA session.During the PA and CI sessions the heart rate was measured using a pulse tracker fixed to the upper arm with an elastic band.

As the researchers also wanted to determine the correlation between anxiety and depression scores in those who   participated more in the yoga intervention than those who did not, there was no single prescribed amount of yoga for any participant. The instructor offered the one-on-one, specialized adapted yoga program to the intervention group twice per week, in their rooms, for the duration of their hospitalization. The program began with 5 min of relaxed   breathing including specific pranayama breath work followed by instructor lead visualization in which the PI guided the expectant mother to imagine each feature of her unborn child, including the shape of the baby\u2019s face, color of the eyes and hair, and picturing a perfectly formed body with arms, legs, fingers and toes. The instructor then asked the mother to silently speak to her baby, sharing any thoughts, dreams or wishes she had about the pregnancy. Guided visualization can reinforce maternal wellbeing and help promote a positive thinking mindset in the mother as well as a positive connection between mother and baby. Breathing and baby visualization was followed by 15 min of modified, bed-adapted yoga moves (such as neck rolls, arm raises, gentle seated rotations, pelvic tilts, thoracic\/lumber stretches and foot pumps, all approved by the director of the neonatal unit as safe and appropriate for mothers with restricted movement) to maintain muscle tone, loosen stiff joints, relieve aching muscles and increase circulation.  The session ended with Yoga Nidra, a 10-min traditional yogic final relaxation to relieve emotional and mental tension and increase the patient\u2019s ability to rest comfortably. The intervention group patients were encouraged to access the video at their own discretion between instructor guided sessions, allowing the study to determine if more yoga sessions, with or without the instructor, would improve patient outcomes. The intervention group also maintained a yoga log that included the total number of sessions with the yoga researcher\/instructor and minutes spent practicing yoga utilizing the video during their hospitalization.","PMID":32056815,"Scores":70},{"ProtocolNumber":99,"ProtocolName":"Supervised aerobic exercise","Classification":"Aerobic exercise","Frequency":3,"Intensity ":"Moderate","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"%HRmax(60-75)","TimesPerSession":"40-50","Type":"Indoor bicycle","Volume":"120-150","PeriodsOfTime":"16:00-18:00","WarmUp":"NA","CoolDown":"NA","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"6 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Score <17 on the Hamilton depression rating scale 17 (HDRS17) at the baseline data assessment;Presence of a somatic condition not permitting regular exercise;Body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg\/m2;Pregnant at the baseline data assessment;Acute suicidal ideation;Comorbid substance dependence (except nicotine);Comorbid major psychiatric disorder.","CombinationTherapy":"Antidepressant medication;Psychotherapy","Protocol":"The intervention consisted of supervised aerobic exercise on indoor bicycles three times per week for six consecutive weeks.

The self-compassion exercises were practiced before the end of each yoga session, with gradually increasing duration and difficulty throughout the treatment period. Generally, affects were discussed in the context of culture and evolution, with a focus on their adaptive and maladaptive expressions with a basis in Tomkins\u2019 Affect theory and modern research on emotion. Participants were also given instructions for analysing and dealing with problematic situations from a CFT perspective, as well as cognitive and behavioural techniques to deal with rumination and repetitive thinking.

Each session lasted approximately 60\u201375 min and consisted of the following: 5\u201310 min warm-up and cool down activities, 6\u20138 PRT exercises and three moderate impact weight-bearing exercises interspersed between the resistance training.  The PRT was designed to be moderate to high intensity and included a combination of upper and lower body machines and free weights, and core strength exercises. The primary exercises used throughout the program focused on major muscle groups with attachments on or near the hip and spine.  This included squats (or leg press), lunges, hip abduction and adduction, latissimus dorsi pull down (or seated row), back extension and a combination of abdominal and core muscle stabilization exercises.  Additional exercises, including leg extension, calf raises, bench press, military press, bicep curls, tricep extension and lumbo-pelvic and spine stabilization exercises, were also rotated throughout  the program to ensure the development of muscle balance. The weight-bearing impact component of the program was designed to load the lower extremities including jumping, landing and stepping exercises. The training program was divided into four distinct 12-week mesocycles.  Each mesocycle is comprised of three 4-week microcycles designed  to become progressively more challenging (progressively increasing 1-RM). During the first 12-week introductory  mesocycle, participants completed three sets of 15\u201320  repetitions at 50\u201360% of their one repetition maximum (1- RM) strength.

For the first 4 weeks of each mesocycle, the  training set was set at an intensity of 60\u201370% of 1-RM,  which increased to 80\u201385% for the remaining 8 weeks of  each mesocycle. All participants were instructed to perform  each repetition in a slow, controlled manner, with a rest of 1\u20132 min between sets.

These data were then used  to automatically adjust the length of the exoskeleton legs and the optimal gait cycle, according to  each individual participantt\u2019s condition.  Each participant then used a suspension vest secured with  elastic straps, which was connected to the harness  mounted on the counterweight system. Depending  on the participant\u2019s initial clinical conditions (e.g., pain, muscle weakness, spasticity, tolerance, fatigue,  or endurance), approximately 40\u201360% (adjustable range, 0\u2013100%) of the total body weight was sustained at the first session and then gradually decreased in 5\u201310% increments per session. Stride length was initially adjusted at 1.0\u20131.6 m\/cycle and walking velocity started at 1.00\u20131.20 km\/h and gradually increased by 0.1 km\/h every 5 min, as tolerated to 2.40\u20132.60 km\/h (maximally adjustable to 3.00 km\/h). The guidance force mode in the WLT system was used to accurately increase active engagement during the robot-assisted gait retraining. As the participant\u2019s walking ability improved from the initial target level (e.g., 40 Nm), the Walkbot system interactively adjusted the walking speed and resistive torque paremeters while attempting to minimize the kinematic trajectory errors. The assistance guidance force was systematically reduced from 100% (passive mode) to 0% (active mode), where the system compensated for the weight, resistance, and inertia in accomplishing symmetrical, optimal gait patterns, as it is capable of applying such a differential mode to the more affected (hemiparetic) leg. Furthermore, realtime audiovisual biofeedback concerning gait kinematics (joint angles), kinetics forces (active, resistive torque, stiffness) on the ankle, knee, and hip interlimb joint movement as well as on the center of the pressure from the force plate mounted on the treadmill. During and after each session, participants were provided with constant verbal encouragement using the knowledge from the results derived from the realtime kinematic and kinetic data. A subcortical locomotor relearning strategy (subconscious, implicit learning) was reinforced by means of asking the participant to kick the ball presented in front of the hemiparetic foot, rather than consciously making an accurate step. Heart rate was monitored to maintain the target HR (220 \u2013 Age) below 55\u201385% and BRPE (<11\u201313), which was in line with American Heart Association (AHA)\/American Stroke Association (ASA) guidelines.

The specific measures include (1)  positive psychological hints, as follows. A) Language  hints: different dialogues were designed according to the  patients\u2019 different personalities and characteristics. Hints were consciously given to the patients by dialogue  during yoga exercise to indicate that the symptoms of  menopause can be effectively relieved. B) Behavior  hints: in addition to correcting the patients\u2019 negative  cognition of menopausal treatment promptly, necessary  and correct health behavior hints were also provided. C) Model hints: the yoga exercise teams were arranged  reasonably. When conditions permitted, those patients  with depression and other symptoms were included in  the same exercise team as those with cheerful personalities,  so that they could be positively affected subtly. (2) Information support is as follows.  A) Evaluation: the  investigator spoke with the patient to obtain a preliminary  understanding of the patient\u2019s personalities, characteristics,  educational level, living environment,  hobbies, lifestyle habits, family lifestyle, and other basic  information to evaluate the patient\u2019s knowledge of  menopause.  B) Multi-channel and multi-form health  education: gynecologists from community hospitals  were invited to incorporate their knowledge of menopausal  syndrome, including the causes, clinical manifestations,  treatment options, drug effects, and influence of  emotions and sleep on the disease, into health  prescriptions and health education manuals with rich  pictures and texts.  The gynecologists also provided  regular health knowledge lectures and led the patients to  understand that pre-menopausal symptoms are normal  physiological changes and that they can easily experience  menopause as long as they develop positive  healthy life behaviors.  The situation of each patient was  evaluated to determine what should be understood, and  one-to-one key explanation was provided to assist the  patient to analyze and correct bad health habits and to  improve positive psychotherapy for the patient. C) Peer  support: during group lectures, yoga practice, and other  crowd-gathering times, peers were encouraged to learn  from each other and share exercises and relaxation methods  suitable for recovery from the disease, including  yoga meditation exercises, relaxation training methods,  and acupressure before bed.  Participants were encouraged  to share happy things with others to ease the  mood, relax the mind, and promote sleep.  D) Continuous  information support: WeChat groups were established  to regularly release relevant disease knowledge; follow up on the patients\u2019 diet, activities, emotions,  sleep, and other conditions; and answer their questions  promptly. Those with privacy protection needs were  contacted via WeChat individually, and telephone follow-  up was conducted once every two weeks for those  who could not access the Internet. During WeChat,  telephone follow-up, or follow-up visits, positive  psychological information support was continued to  provide the patients with positive hints and supervision. E)Yoga exercise: yoga exercise was carried out for up  to 24 weeks, three times a week, 60 minutes every time. An appropriate combination of yoga exercise was  compiled according to the physiological condition of the  patient. A professionally trained yoga instructor from  the yoga club demonstrated the movements during the  intervention, and the instructor used gentle language and  movements to guide the patient\u2019s training and meditation. Precautions for warming up and exercise were  given to the patient before each treatment. After the  training was completed, the instructor exchanged experiences,  especially the positive and peaceful life  attitudes advocated by yoga, with the patient. At the  same time, before the intervention, the investigator  explained the significance of the study to the participants  in the control group and emphasized that they  could not participate in any other exercises such as  jogging and tai chi for six months.","PMID":33370736,"Scores":65},{"ProtocolNumber":143,"ProtocolName":"Virtually supervised exercise using intradialytic exergame","Classification":"Flexibility exercise","Frequency":3,"Intensity ":"Light","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"NA","TimesPerSession":30,"Type":"Foot rotation, including inversion\/eversion and dorsiflexion\/plantarflexion","Volume":90,"PeriodsOfTime":"During hemodialysis treatment","WarmUp":"NA","CoolDown":"NA","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"YES","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"4 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Severe uncorrected visual impairment (based on the judgement of the investigator) or severe cognitive impairment (a mini-mental state examination score less than 16), which could limit the ability to interact with the intradialytic exergame interface;Had major amputation;Non-ambulatory or had severe gait or balance problems (e.g., unable to walk a distance of 15 m independently with or without assistive devices or unable to stand still without moving their feet);Active foot ulcers or active infection;Major foot deformity (e.g., Charcot neuroarthropathy);Had changes in psychotropic or sleep medications in the past 6 weeks;Taken any antidepressant agents in the past 6 weeks;Any clinically significant medical or psychiatric conditions;Unwilling to participate. ","CombinationTherapy":"NA","Protocol":"The Exergame Group(EG) performed the proposed four-week intradialytic exergame program under non-weight-bearing conditions during their routine hemodialysis treatment, for three sessions per week (for total of 12 exercise sessions), which were 30 min long, including breaks. Validated inertial sensors were used to estimate three-dimensional joint angles needed for providing real-time feedback during the intradialytic exercise. Sensors were attached on the top of each foot of the participants in the EG using elastic straps. Each LEGSys module consists of a triaxial accelerometer (\u00b12 g) and a triaxial gyroscope (\u00b12000 deg\/s). It can estimate real-time three-dimensional foot rotation, including inversion\/eversion and dorsiflexion\/plantarflexion, using the Kalman filter and quaternion approach described in detail in our previous studies. Sensor data were acquired at the sampling rate of 100Hz and transmitted to an interactive interface we designed and installed on a standard laptop. The measured foot rotations from the sensor were mapped to the displacement of a laptop cursor. By rotating their foot, the participant could navigate the laptop cursor to execute a simple reaching task game. Participants were instructed to rotate their feet to navigate the cursor on the laptop screen to target circles that appeared on the same screen. Exercise tasks started with simple point-to-point foot rotation in dorsiflexion and plantarflexion (navigating the cursor up and down). Later, more complex exercise tasks were provided, which required complex movement of the foot, including medial\/lateral rotation with different angles as well as motor\u2013cognitively challenged exercise such as the foot rotation and working memory exercise. The point-to-point foot rotation exercise was a motor exercise that required accurate mapping of foot rotation to the displacement of the laptop cursor. For the point-to-point foot rotation exercise, only the cursor (red square) and one target (solid circle) presented on the screen each time. After a visual start signal, the participant was instructed to navigate the red cursor into the target circle by rotating his\/her foot. If the participant successfully completed a task (i.e., moved and stopped the cursor within the center of the target circle), the target circle disappeared, followed by the appearance of a new target circle at another location. Then, the participant repeated the task. For each task, the participant was required to rotate his\/her foot up to 30 degrees (equivalent to the distance between target circles) as fast as possible. If this amount of foot rotation (30 degrees) was too difficult for the participant (e.g., the participant\u2019s foot was too rigid), the intradialytic exergame program provided adjustable difficulty levels by increasing the mapping scale. With the largest mapping scale, the participant only needed to rotate his\/her foot up to 10 degrees to navigate the cursor into target circles. Similarly, if the exercise was too simple for the participant, the mapping scale could be reduced to force the participant rotating his\/her foot up to 40 degrees to complete the task. The participant was expected to compete a task rapidly (<2-s). Upon completing a task in less than 2-s, the participant was rewarded with visual (the circle exploded) and audio (positive sound) feedbacks. If the participant moved too slowly (>2-s), the participant would receive a visual feedback informing the slow execution of the task (i.e., the color of the target circle changed from yellow to green). The foot rotation and working memory exercise (dual-task exercise) was a motor\u2013cognitive exercise that requires accurate coordination of foot motion while performing a cognitive task. For this exercise, a total of six circles appeared on the screen: one home circle in white and five target circles in yellow. The target circles were located in a fanwise position in front of the home circle. Each target circle was marked with a number or letter (\u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201c3\u201d, \u201cA\u201d, or \u201cB\u201d) in a randomized order. The exercise began with the cursor (red square) positioning in the home circle. The participant was instructed to navigate the cursor from the home circle to the center of a target circle in the alternative order of the numbers and letters. Specifically, the participant navigated the cursor from the home circle to the center of the first target circle that had number \u201c1\u201d inside. Next, the participant navigated the cursor back to the home circle, and then to the second target circle that had the letter \u201cA\u201d inside. The participant repeated these tasks in the order of \u201chome\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, \u201chome\u201d, \u201cA\u201d, \u201chome\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201chome\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, \u201chome\u201d, \u201c3\u201d. If the participant navigated the cursor to a correct target circle, the target circle would turn red and explode with a positive rewarding sound. If the participant navigated the cursor to a wrong target circle, visual and audio feedback would be provided indicating the mistake. If the participant made a mistake, the participant would be instructed to go back to the home circle and re-do the task until successful completion. If the participant made three consecutive mistakes, a visual cue (a flashing target circle) would appear to inform the correct order.","PMID":32178231,"Scores":80},{"ProtocolNumber":144,"ProtocolName":"Nurse-supervised intradialytic exercise","Classification":"Flexibility exercise","Frequency":3,"Intensity ":"Light","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"NA","TimesPerSession":30,"Type":"Non-weight-bearing foot rotation","Volume":90,"PeriodsOfTime":"During hemodialysis treatment","WarmUp":"NA","CoolDown":"NA","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"4 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Severe uncorrected visual impairment (based on the judgement of the investigator) or severe cognitive impairment (a mini-mental state examination score less than 16), which could limit the ability to interact with the intradialytic exergame interface;Had major amputation;Non-ambulatory or had severe gait or balance problems (e.g., unable to walk a distance of 15 m independently with or without assistive devices or unable to stand still without moving their feet);Active foot ulcers or active infection;Major foot deformity (e.g., Charcot neuroarthropathy);Had changes in psychotropic or sleep medications in the past 6 weeks;Taken any antidepressant agents in the past 6 weeks;Any clinically significant medical or psychiatric conditions;Unwilling to participate.

Each participant was asked to attend a total of 8 groups (over 4 weeks).  Each group was designed to have a maximum of 12 participants.  The LY  groups were facilitated by one experienced certified lead LY trainer and  supported by one of the three co-investigators who were also certified LY facilitators.  In order to maintain consistency in the content of the LY  group intervention across different groups the lead facilitator followed  a pre-designed intervention content schedule.  The three co-investigators monitored the lead LY trainer's fidelity to this planned  schedule of activities using a pre-designed checklist.  Each session included the four essential steps of LY with integrated  laughter meditation and grounding exercises. The intervention also  provides an opportunity to connect with other people in the group in an  enjoyable way. The four steps of LY are composed of (1) warm up exercises (e.g. clapping and body movement, (2) deep breathing exercises, (3) childlike playfulness and (4) laughter exercises (e.g. greeting  laughter, lion laughter and other self-created laughter exercises, and  closing cheers).  Laughter meditation involves focusing on the experience of laughter  and the associated bodily sensations.  The resulting focus on the presentmoment is hypothesized to provide temporary relief from negative  thoughts and rumination whilst providing an opportunity for a release  of negative emotions.  Unconditional or genuine laughter is often experienced during laughter meditation;  this can become infectious and  trigger laughter in other people within the group, hence creating  greater connections with group members.  The grounding exercises  generally consist of a brief guided relaxation with deep breathing and  are designed to enable participants to ground the energy of laughter and relax after each laughter exercise.  The childlike playfulness aspect  of LY is integrated into many of the laughter exercises through acting  and improvisation, it is intended to reduce inhibitions, cultivate a sense  of openness and convert simulated laughter into genuine laughter  during the groups.  This sense of playfulness and openness is reinforced  at the end of each laughter exercise by swinging the arms and chanting \u201cVery good\u201d, \u201cVery good\u201d and \u201cYay\u201d.  An example of a laughter exercise  incorporating playfulness is the \u201cmilkshake laughter\u201d exercise, in which  participants pour and mix the ingredients of two imaginary glasses of  milk by chanting \u201cAeee\u201d and then laugh when pretending that they are  drinking the milkshake.  A selection of different LY exercises were  conducted in each group to avoid repetition.  Participants were also  given a LY workbook and encouraged to practice the LY exercises individually outside the group sessions (i.e. at home).","PMID":30711868,"Scores":70},{"ProtocolNumber":151,"ProtocolName":"Endurance training","Classification":"Aerobic exercise","Frequency":"2-3","Intensity ":"NA","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"\u2264%HRmax(85)","TimesPerSession":30,"Type":"Outdoor walking;Nordic walking;Running in groups of up to five patients;Indoor on stationary bicycles","Volume":"60-90","PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"NA","CoolDown":"NA","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"3-4 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Comorbid psychiatric disorders(except comorbid ICD-10 diagnoses of the chapters F4, F5 and F6);Cardiovascular or neurological disease;Intellectual disability;Incapacity to provide informed consent.

Workshops are facilitated by a certified Sudarshan Kriya Yoga(SKY) instructor. Stress buster sessions cover: basic breathing techniques to eliminate stress and tension; guided meditations and processes that calm the mind; knowledge of impacts of lifestyle on health; skills for handling negative emotions and everyday situations and practical advice on improving work and interpersonal relationships. These components are reinforced at the weekend workshop, in which participants are taught SKY techniques, together with cognitive coping and stressor evaluation strategies. Follow-up sessions provide an opportunity for participants to practice techniques with feedback and support from the instructor. Although it is recommended that participants attend the whole programme, this is not a requirement and participants may attend as many sessions as they wish. The practice of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga involves the use of three breathing techniques: three stage Ujjayi (\u2018victory breath\u2019), a slow deep breathing technique with a specific ratio of inhalation, exhalation and breath holds; Bhastrika (\u2018bellows breath\u2019), involving 1 min rounds of faster more vigorous breath, followed by a few minutes of normal breathing; Sudarshan Kriya (\u2018healing breath\u2019), an advanced cyclical breathing exercise of slow, medium and fast rates in succession. These practices are done in a sitting posture with eyes closed; specific arm positions\/movements are used to enhance inhalation, exhalation and breath-holds. Daily SKY practice takes around 10 min. SKY instruction involves longer group sessions, lasting ~30 min. The Manage Your Mind programme provides SKY instruction and practice as part of the intensive weekend workshop. Victory breath and bellows breath are also taught as part of the weekly \u2018stress buster sessions\u2019.","PMID":32799993,"Scores":25},{"ProtocolNumber":157,"ProtocolName":"Yoga based mind body intervention","Classification":"Yoga","Frequency":5,"Intensity ":"NA","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"NA","TimesPerSession":17,"Type":"Session preparation instructions;Starting Prayer;Yogic sukshma vyama(Finger loosening, Wrist loosening, Elbow loosening, Shoulder loosening, Toe bending, Ankle bending, Knee cap tightening, patella movement, Knee  bending & Hip rotation);Yogic sthool vyama(Rekhagati, Sarvaangpushti)","Volume":600,"PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"NA","CoolDown":"NA","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"8 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Any other autoimmune disease;Pregnant women or lactating mothers;History of recent intake of oral\/intra-articular steroids in past 6 months;Physically unfit for yoga.","CombinationTherapy":"NA","Protocol":"Patients of yoga group underwent 8 weeks pretested yoga based mind body intervention (MBI) program which was designed  in such a way that it least likely created any further  irritation in inflamed joints.

The structured  exercise training protocol included resistance training for the development of local muscular strength, endurance and power and aerobic  exercise for the development of cardiorespiratory fitness (aerobic fitness) across four blocks of progressive intensity (A, B, C and D), and  adhered to National Strength and Conditioning Association guidelines. The intensity of the resistance training was prescribed according to  the following protocol.

Briefly, exercise was performed on a stationary bicycle with ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), using Borg\u2019s 6 to 20 rating scale, used both to prescribe the intensity of the exercise for the moderate session and to evaluate exertion during both moderate and preferred sessions. Before the first session, participants were provided with standardized RPE instructions according to the manual. Participants self-reported their RPE every 5 min during exercise.

During the entirety of both sessions, the RPE scale was affixed to the wall in front of the participant to allow participants to self-monitor their exertion throughout the 20 min of exercise. Participants were instructed to maintain 60 to 70 rpm and adjust the resistance to maintain the intensity instructions for each session.

Sessions were held at the fitness centre in  a conference room or office at weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11.  Participants also had email  access to the counsellor once per week.  The intervention was based on social-cognitive theory.  The counsellor utilized several motivational strategies  such as behavioural contracts for exercise goals, lists of personal barriers to exercise  and potential solutions, goal-setting, and problem-solving.  The sessions also emphasized the benefits of exercise for depressed patients. Participants were provided with written educational materials on exercise and  were encouraged to reread and think about the session topic at home prior to the  next scheduled session.

During the initial meeting, the  rationale behind PA for the treatment of depression was  described to participants.  It was explained that depression  may cause an individual to become less active, due to low  energy and lack of motivation.  The purpose of the PA  intervention is to increase physical activity levels, which may  result in a variety of benefits, such as improved mood and  increases in self-efficacy.  After the treatment rationale was  provided, participants developed detailed PA objectives,  gradually increasing in duration, frequency and\/or intensity  over the eight weeks of the program.  A concrete agenda was  created and action plans were defined for each PA goal.  To  facilitate inter-participant comparisons and general conclusions, activity goals were encouraged to be aerobic in nature  and to foster feelings of competence, control and\/or fitness  gains.  Similar to the behavioral activation(BA) intervention, participants were asked  to complete a detailed logbook, outlining the physical  activities they engaged in over the eight weeks. For both BA and PA conditions, participants were  contacted by the first author every two weeks by phone to  monitor their depressive symptoms.  During these calls, the  first author used behavior change techniques, including selfmonitoring of behavior, problem solving and goal setting, which have been repeatedly shown in  research to effectively promote change.  Specifically, the purpose of the calls was to go over the  participant\u2019s weekly objectives, to help them work out past or  potential obstacles, and to help them establish new goals for  the upcoming two weeks.

To ensure that seasonality was not an issue, accelerometers were collected simultaneously from all the participants. By measuring the magnitude and frequency of the acceleration, the device determines the level of intensity (metabolic equivalents: METs) generated by activity every 10 seconds from 0\u20139 METs (i.e. where 0 is the lowest and 9 is the highest). The data were only considered valid from the participants who wore the accelerometer for at least a total of 10 hours (600 minutes) daily for at least 4 weekdays and a weekend day. The duration of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was calculated on a daily basis and used to estimate weekly activity by calculating a weighted average of daily weekday and weekend activity (i.e. weekly MVPA=[average daily weekday MVPA \u00d7 5] + [average daily weekend MVPA \u00d7 2]).

This program has been successfully used in several of our center-based exercise trials and is enjoyable and well-tolerated by older adults. In order to effectively adapt and improve this program for delivery by DVD, we conducted focus groups with older adults to maximize the effectiveness of the program in the home environment. For whole-body (i.e., combination moves involving legs, abdominals, and arms) and partial-body (e.g., arms-only) strengthening exercises, 12 repetitions are performed in each set, and for balance (e.g., standing on one foot while holding chair) and flexibility (e.g., hamstring stretch) exercises, poses are held for up to 20 seconds. Each exercise session also includes a brief aerobic warm-up, and a series of stretches for all major muscle groups are performed as part of both the warm-up and cool-down. Participants are instructed to exercise with the FlexToBa\u2122 DVDs three times per week on non-consecutive days. The program is modeled and narrated by a trained exercise leader who provides a detailed explanation and demonstration of each movement prior to leading participants through that exercise. Participants have the option to play the DVD without these detailed instructions once they become familiar with the exercises. Throughout the DVDs, the exercise leader is accompanied by three age-appropriate models who completed a similar, onsite exercise training program prior to DVD production. The DVD set includes six separate exercise sessions, each of which is intended to be used for four weeks. The exercise sessions are designed to be progressive in nature. For example, Session One consists of relatively simple exercises which can be completed from a standing or seated position (e.g., bicep curls with band, one leg stand). Session Two is slightly more challenging than Session One, as it incorporates exercises to be completed on the floor. As participants move into the second half of the program (Sessions 4\u20136), the difficulty level is increased by utilizing more complex exercises that involve multiple movements (e.g., bicep curl to shoulder press) and additional balance components (e.g., triceps extension while balancing on one leg). A particularly unique aspect of the program and of particular importance to older adults is a component that allows participants to progress at their own pace by making use of movement modifications. For each exercise, the exercise leader also demonstrates a modified version that is slightly less difficult and a more challenging version that adds difficulty for those who have mastered the exercise.

This intervention seeked to support smoking cessation by reinforcing commitment to abstinence and solving participants\u2019 problems about maintaining smoking abstinence. The intervention also aimed to improve the mental health of women. The physical activity intervention combined supervised exercise sessions with physical activity consultations. All sessions were individual and took place in a private room at the hospital or in a community health centre or children\u2019s centre. Fourteen sessions of supervised exercise were offered over eight weeks; twice a week for six weeks, followed by weekly sessions for two weeks. At each session participants were asked to walk at a moderate intensity on a treadmill for up to 30 min. At the first two treadmill sessions, and then on alternate occasions (total of nine consultations), they received the physical activity consultations, which aimed to identify opportunities to incorporate physical activity into women\u2019s daily lives and to help them use behavioural strategies to improve adherence to these plans. These 20 min consultations incorporated 19 behaviour change techniques, as previously described in the protocol. Participants were advised to be active for at least 10 bouts, progressing towards 30 min of activity on at least five days a week, with an emphasis on brisk walking.

This intervention seeked to support smoking cessation by reinforcing commitment to abstinence and solving participants\u2019 problems about maintaining smoking abstinence. The intervention also aimed to improve the mental health of women. The physical activity intervention combined supervised exercise sessions with physical activity consultations. All sessions were individual and took place in a private room at the hospital or in a community health centre or children\u2019s centre. Fourteen sessions of supervised exercise were offered over eight weeks; twice a week for six weeks, followed by weekly sessions for two weeks. At each session participants were asked to walk at a moderate intensity on a treadmill for up to 30 min. At the first two treadmill sessions, and then on alternate occasions (total of nine consultations), they received the physical activity consultations, which aimed to identify opportunities to incorporate physical activity into women\u2019s daily lives and to help them use behavioural strategies to improve adherence to these plans. These 20 min consultations incorporated 19 behaviour change techniques, as previously described in the protocol. Participants were advised to be active for at least 10 bouts, progressing towards 30 min of activity on at least five days a week, with an emphasis on brisk walking.

Home practices were monitored by a family member for the next 2 months. They were also instructed to maintain a log of each day's yoga at home filled by the family members. The yoga professional was formally trained with a graduate medical degree (5 years) in yoga and naturopathy with 2 years\u2019 postgraduate degree in yoga. Efforts were made to maintain 100% attendance. The patients receiving yoga were encouraged to report any untoward event that they had experienced during the course of the study. During the 3 months of study, the patients on antidepressant medications received a consultation with their respective psychiatrists. Antidepressant type and dose were not controlled. However, the medications, their dosage, and changes, if any, were noted. The treatment remained unchanged in nearly all patients. Antidepressants administered were escitalopram (10\u201315 mg\/day; n = 63), fluoxetine (20\u201340 mg\/day; n = 30), duloxetine (60 mg\/day; n = 1), sertraline (50\u2013 100 mg\/day; n = 3); amitriptyline (25\u2013 100 mg\/day; n = 13), mirtazapine (7.5\u201315 mg\/day; n = 4). In addition, some patients were given benzodiazepines (lorazepam up to 3 mg\/day or alprazolam 1.5 mg\/day). The researcher had a telephonic conversation with all the participants to inquire regarding their medication\/yoga practice compliance at home.","PMID":29736060,"Scores":50},{"ProtocolNumber":218,"ProtocolName":"Individualized Web-based exercise program","Classification":"Aerobic exercise","Frequency":"2-3","Intensity ":"Moderate to vigorous","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"RPE(3-7)\/Borg(0-10)","TimesPerSession":"20-60","Type":"Walking;Jogging","Volume":"40-180","PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"NA","CoolDown":"NA","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"YES","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"8 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"NA","ExerciseContraindications":"Use of antidepressive medications or benzodiazepines at doses that have not been stable for at least 6 weeks prior to Screening; Psychotherapy that started less than 8 weeks prior to Screening; Any clinically significant psychiatric illness other than major depression or bipolar affective disorder; Transient ischemic attack or stroke or any unexplained loss of consciousness within 1 year prior to Screening; Any uncontrolled medical or neurological\/neurodegenerative condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might impair treatment compliance and adherence; History of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV), or clinically significant conduction abnormalities (e.g., unstable atrial fibrillation) within 1 year prior to Screening; Clinically significant 12-lead ECG abnormalities, as determined by the Investigator; Uncontrolled hypertension defined as: average of 3 systolic blood pressure [SBP]\/diastolic blood pressure [DBP] readings > 165\/100 mmHg at Screening; History of malignancy or carcinoma, with the following exceptions:i) Subjects with cancers in remission more than 5 years prior to Screening. ii) Subjects with a history of excised or treated basal cell or squamous carcinoma. iii) Subjects with prostate cancer in situ.

In the gym of the nursing home, each patient was engaged in three sessions of physical exercise a week, with each session lasting approximately 45 minutes, under instruction of a therapist. All patients followed a personal exercise program, characterized by walking, balance test and posture strengthening exercises. The physical activity was moderately intense so as not to exceed the target pulse rate, meaning 75% of the maximum pulse rate for the patient being treated (based on the theoretical maximum pulse rate by age, or on the Borg scale). Blood pressure, resting heart rate and pulsoximetry were assessed before and after exercise. The HBP is a fully articulated orthesis, consisting of four basic elements. The first modular and plastic element is that which rests on the back. The second, cranio-cervical, element is characterized by a helmet placed on the wearer\u2019s head and on the top of which is inserted a cervical spring mechanism which connects the helmet to the dorsal element, thus enabling complex head and neck movements. The third, modular and plastic, lombo-sacral, element is positioned at the centre of the sacrum.

The counselor gave participants lists of free\/lost cost resources to help them select activities that can be done inside (e.g., walk-at-home DVDs), outside (e.g., bike paths), irrespective of weather (e.g., mall walking), and that are easily integrated into daily life (e.g., walking dog; grocery shopping; using stairs rather than elevators; walking in place while watching TV\/listening to music). Counselors then oriented participants to the proper use of the Fitbit activity tracker, offering tips for self-monitoring step counts, duration and frequency of physical activity goals. Lastly, participants were given a starting step-count goal of 4,500 steps\/day with a plan for increasing steps\/day by 500 steps each week of the intervention. After participants were discharged from the Partial Hospitalization Alcohol and Drug Treatment Program, the study counselor called participants at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 of the intervention for a 30-minute telephone session. The study counselor reinforced participants for wearing the Fitbit and praised efforts toward increasing physical activity during the prior week(s) as well as provided encouragement for continued engagement in the intervention. Participants were asked about whether the prior step goal(s) felt appropriate, too easy, or too challenging. If women reported difficulty meeting goals, the subsequent goal would not be increased, but remained the same, with emphasis placed on identifying barriers to increased physical activity. Participants were instructed to self-monitor physical activity in 3 ways: 1) looking at the data displayed on the Fitbit device itself, 2) checking their Bluetooth-enabled smartphone\/tablet Fitbit application, and 3) by logging in to Fitbit.com on any internet-enabled computer (Fitbit provides a small USB device that allows for wireless data transfer from the activity tracker to one\u2019s computer). Given that most sedentary individuals accumulate 3,000\u20134,000 steps per day, participants were given the goal of achieving 4,500 steps\/day at week 1 and increasing each week of the intervention by 500 steps\/day (about \u00bc mile increase). This increase in steps would eventually result in most participants achieving an average of 10,000 steps a day by the end of the intervention, which is equivalent to the American College of Sports Medicine\u2019s (ACSM) current recommendations for physical activity.","PMID":28755778,"Scores":55},{"ProtocolNumber":263,"ProtocolName":"Aerobic exercise plus pharmacotherapy","Classification":"Aerobic exercise","Frequency":3,"Intensity ":"Moderate","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"%HRmax(72);RPE(12-13)\/(Borg 6-20)","TimesPerSession":30,"Type":"Traditional games, indoor\/outdoor natural circuit workouts with resistance bands, jump ropes, fitness balls, brisk walking, and dancing","Volume":"135-150","PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"10min","CoolDown":"5min","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"16 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"NA","ExerciseContraindications":"NA","CombinationTherapy":"Antidepressant medication ","Protocol":"Nine patients in the EG performed aerobic exercise, 45\u201350 min\/session, three times\/week, for 16 weeks.

The participants were asked to attend pre-selected classes, but could also chose to participate in a different class if it was more convenient, but were always recommended to select classes of similar intensity. To ensure the intensity levels differed between the recommended gym classes, members of the research team designed classes of differing intensity that were tested using indirect calorimetry and pulse watches in a laboratory setting. They then attended different classes at the gym using pulse watches and compared the results with the laboratory classes. The results were used to select classes of differing intensities to recommend to the participants (classes described above).

The participants were asked to attend pre-selected classes, but could also chose to participate in a different class if it was more convenient, but were always recommended to select classes of similar intensity. To ensure the intensity levels differed between the recommended gym classes, members of the research team designed classes of differing intensity that were tested using indirect calorimetry and pulse watches in a laboratory setting. They then attended different classes at the gym using pulse watches and compared the results with the laboratory classes. The results were used to select classes of differing intensities to recommend to the participants (classes described above).  Additionally, measurements of heart rate from the different sessions were then compared with various classes at the gym, also to identify classes of similar intensity. Lastly, differences in exercise intensity between classes were confirmed by analysing heart rate data collected from pulse watches worn by the participants during the trial.

Detailed instruction manuals for the exercise program helped assure consistency, and exercise sessions were led by a certified personal trainer. Exercise consisted of fast-paced, low-resistance cycling for 20 minutes followed by strength training for 20 minutes using a progressive sequence of resistance bands. After 12 weeks, individuals continued to exercise on their own, using either weight machines or resistance bands.","PMID":28579759,"Scores":65},{"ProtocolNumber":294,"ProtocolName":"Self-guided chronic disease self-management plus exercise","Classification":"Exercise","Frequency":"\u2265 3","Intensity ":"NA","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"NA","TimesPerSession":"NA","Type":"NA","Volume":"NA","PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"NA","CoolDown":"NA","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"12 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"NA","ExerciseContraindications":"Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of <24;Unstable cardiovascular disease;High fall risk;Other uncontrolled chronic conditions that would interfere with the safety and conduct of the protocol or interpretation of the results.","CombinationTherapy":"Self-guided chronic disease self-management (CDSM)","Protocol":"Self-guided chronic disease self-management plus exercise(SGE) participants had a single initial in-person group orientation to the same fitness facility followed by flexible and free access.

Each participant received an introductory 20\u201330 minute individual meeting with a yoga instructor. We offered group classes twice per week; participants were expected to attend at least one class per week with the option of attending two per week for 10 weeks. Classes were 80-minutes. Classes included breathing exercises (pranayama) and seated meditation; warm-ups and half sun salutations; standing postures (asanas); seated postures; an inversion and a twist; shavasana (relaxation); and wrap-up and discussion of home practice. Instructors had a list of asanas and other practices from which they chose. Similar to many community classes, classes accommodated rolling admission. Instructors were asked to encourage mindful attention to the present moment throughout class, and to repeatedly guide participants through the connection between breath and movement. Instructors tailored the pace of class to the participants present; generally, the class occurred at a gentle pace. To facilitate home practice, we gave each participant a yoga mat, descriptions of suggested practices, two videos featuring study instructors, and a commercial yoga DVD (LifeForce Yoga\u00ae to Beat the Blues \u2013 Level1 by Amy Weintraub). All yoga instructors were Registered Yoga Teachers \u00ae with the Yoga Alliance. Yoga instructors also received study-specific training. Using audiorecordings and a structured tool, yoga supervisors Dr. Tremont and Mr. Gillette rated a subset of 55 classes throughout the duration of the study for instructor manual fidelity. Fidelity was excellent for class content (mean fidelity = 95%) and teaching style (mean fidelity= 94%). Yoga instructors met monthly for peer consultation.

During these sessions, an individualized yoga practice was developed and taught to the participant, and given for him or her to do at home. The yoga practice conformed to the consensus statement and individualized for each participant according to his or her presenting symptoms, needs, abilities, goals, and circumstances (a classical approach to yoga practice or yoga therapy known as the viniyoga of yoga). Each individualized yoga practice specified appropriate physical postures and movement; breathing exercises;relaxation; mindfulness and meditation; and other aspects of yoga practice such as cultivation of positive values, thoughts and attitudes, and  lifestyle factors. Some components were recommended for reducing both depression and anxiety, some were recommended to include or avoid specifically for depression or anxiety. Teacher and participant established an agreement on suitable parameters of the yoga practice, including time of day, duration, and frequency. Participants were taught their yoga practice during the sessions, and a written copy of  the practice, including diagrams and instructions, was taken to assist  with doing the practice at home. A summary of key components of each practice was recorded by the teacher. Depending on the participant\u2019s feedback and the teacher\u2019s observations at each consultation, the yoga practice may have been revised or developed over the course  of the four sessions. Actual amount of yoga done, and adherence to the given practice were recorded at each subsequent session. Encouraging reminders were given to participants  by phone call, SMS, or email in weeks when consultation sessions were  not conducted. Fifteen qualified yoga teachers provided the yoga sessions. All participants were asked to continue their current treatment  as usual (regular care), including any medications, complementary therapies, counseling, psychotherapy, or other mental health services.","PMID":27030303,"Scores":40},{"ProtocolNumber":319,"ProtocolName":"Physical activity intervention","Classification":"Aerobic exercise","Frequency":3,"Intensity ":"Moderate","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"RPE(13)\/(Borg 6-20)","TimesPerSession":40,"Type":"Walking","Volume":"120-180","PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"Yes","CoolDown":"Yes","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"YES","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"8 weeks(1st to 8th weeks)","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure, clinically significant aortic stenosis, history of cardiac arrest, use of a cardiac defibrillator, or uncontrolled angina;Lung disease requiring either oral or injected steroids, or the use of supplemental oxygen;Mini-Mental State Exam\uff1c21;Severe arthritis (either osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis);Cancer requiring treatment in the past 3 years;Development of chest pain or severe shortness of breath on the 400m self-paced walk test;Parkinson\u2019s disease or other serious neurological disorders;Renal disease requiring dialysis;Other illness of such severity that life expectancy is considered to be less than 12 months;Current diagnosis of schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, or bipolar disorder;Current consumption of more than 14 alcoholic drinks per week;Clinical judgment concerning participant safety or noncompliance.","CombinationTherapy":"Group-mediated counseling;Home-based physical activity(once a week for weeks 4 and 5; twice a week for weeks 6-8);Telephone counseling(1 time per month)","Protocol":"The physical activity intervention will employ a combination of aerobic, strength, balance, and  flexibility exercises.  The intervention is divided into 3 phases: adoption (weeks 1\u20138), transition (weeks 9\u201324), and maintenance (weeks 25 to end of trial).  Exercise training will be primarily center-based  during the adoption phase with a systematic transition to home-based exercise.  As undertaken in other programs with older adults, each participant randomized to the  physical activity group receives a 45-min individualized, face-to-face introductory session prior to  beginning exercise training. Additionally, participants attend two lectures with the exercise physiologist to review the components of the FITT principle (the role of  frequency, intensity, time, and type of activity in an exercise prescription) and to examine the difference  between exercise and physical activity. The training regimen includes 10  weekly closed-group counseling sessions that focus on physical activity and the prevention of physical  disability.  Emphasis is placed on the development of motivation and skills to promote adherence and an  increase of all forms of physical activity throughout the day, including leisure sports, advanced ADLs (e.g.,  yard work), use of stairs as opposed to escalators, and leisurely walks with friends. Walking is the primary mode of physical activity, given its widespread popularity and ease of  administration in older persons. Other forms of endurance activity (e.g., stationary cycling) are,  however, utilized on a limited basis when regular walking is contraindicated. According to the Surgeon General\u2019s recommendations, the walking component has a weekly goal of at least 150 min performed 5  or more days of the week, which will be approached in a progressive and individualized manner across  the first 3 months of the trial. Each session is preceded by a brief warm-up and followed by a brief cool-down period. Moreover,  participants perform 10-min lower extremity strengthening exercises by using variable weight ankle  weights followed by a brief lower extremity stretching protocol. Supplemental materials are supplied to  reinforce the strength training so that it can be generalized to the home environment. Balance training is also introduced during the initial (adoption) phase of the program. The physical activity intervention begins with lighter intensity activity, which gradually increases over  the first 2\u20133 weeks. LIFE promotes walking at a moderate intensity as assessed by Borg\u2019s ratings of  perceived exertion scale, which has a range from 6 (no exertion at all) to 20 (maximal exertion). Participants are asked to walk at an intensity of 13 (SOMEWHAT HARD); they are discouraged  from exercising at levels \u226515 (HARD) or \u226411 (FAIRLY LIGHT). Strengthening exercises are performed (2 sets of 10 repetitions) at an intensity of 15 to 16. The intervention is divided into 3 phases: adoption (weeks 1\u20138), transition (weeks 9\u201324), and  maintenance (week 25 to end of trial). In the adoption phase, participants attend center-based exercises (40\u201360 min) 3 times each week, have group counseling sessions once a week, and receive a telephone  contact one time each month. The center-based contacts are used to initiate the walking program and to  introduce participants to the strength, stretching, and balance portions of the program in a safe and effective manner. A gradual phasing in of home-based physical activity begins at week 4. During the transition phase, center-based exercise occurs 2 times each week, with group counseling  contacts during the first 2 weeks, and phone contacts each month. These sessions are supplemented by home-based endurance\/strengthening\/flexibility exercises performed at least 3 times each week. Appropriate community based exercise facilities (e.g., YMCAs; senior centers) are identified for those  preferring to undertake center-based activities on a more frequent basis. During the maintenance phase,  center-based exercise is offered one time each week (optional) with monthly phone contacts.

Other forms of endurance activity (e.g., stationary cycling) are,  however, utilized on a limited basis when regular walking is contraindicated. According to the Surgeon General\u2019s recommendations, the walking component has a weekly goal of at least 150 min performed 5  or more days of the week, which will be approached in a progressive and individualized manner across  the first 3 months of the trial. Each session is preceded by a brief warm-up and followed by a brief cool-down period. Moreover,  participants perform 10-min lower extremity strengthening exercises by using variable weight ankle  weights followed by a brief lower extremity stretching protocol. Supplemental materials are supplied to  reinforce the strength training so that it can be generalized to the home environment. Balance training is also introduced during the initial (adoption) phase of the program. The physical activity intervention begins with lighter intensity activity, which gradually increases over  the first 2\u20133 weeks. LIFE promotes walking at a moderate intensity as assessed by Borg\u2019s ratings of  perceived exertion scale, which has a range from 6 (no exertion at all) to 20 (maximal exertion). Participants are asked to walk at an intensity of 13 (SOMEWHAT HARD); they are discouraged  from exercising at levels \u226515 (HARD) or \u226411 (FAIRLY LIGHT). Strengthening exercises are performed (2 sets of 10 repetitions) at an intensity of 15 to 16. The intervention is divided into 3 phases: adoption (weeks 1\u20138), transition (weeks 9\u201324), and  maintenance (week 25 to end of trial). In the adoption phase, participants attend center-based exercises (40\u201360 min) 3 times each week, have group counseling sessions once a week, and receive a telephone  contact one time each month. The center-based contacts are used to initiate the walking program and to  introduce participants to the strength, stretching, and balance portions of the program in a safe and effective manner. A gradual phasing in of home-based physical activity begins at week 4. During the transition phase, center-based exercise occurs 2 times each week, with group counseling  contacts during the first 2 weeks, and phone contacts each month. These sessions are supplemented by home-based endurance\/strengthening\/flexibility exercises performed at least 3 times each week. Appropriate community based exercise facilities (e.g., YMCAs; senior centers) are identified for those  preferring to undertake center-based activities on a more frequent basis. During the maintenance phase,  center-based exercise is offered one time each week (optional) with monthly phone contacts.

They took place in the first 2 hours of hemodialysis on the seat the patient used for dialysis. Trainings were constantly supervised by a nephrologist and a physiotherapist. Each training was divided into three parts: 1) Introductory part, a short warm-up lasting 5 minutes. It included active exercises of the lower limbs in recumbent position. 2) Main part, 10-15 min. In this part, depending on the training allocated: Group 1 performed endurance training on a MOTOmed letto2cycle ergometer which is a motorized exercise therapy device that has a CE 0124, EMV, ISO Qualit\u00e4tsmanagement safety certificate which enables a patient to ride in a recumbent or reclined position. Training on ergometer concentrates on lower limbs, the position was chosen by the patient according to their comfort and, just as important, to the fluency of dialysis. Training intensity was selected on the basis of subjective feelings of the patient and steadily increased from low to moderate levels based on a 10-point fatigue assessment (Borg scale). This is a reliable indicator for evaluating the intensity of physical exercise, among dialysis patients. In the first week of training the length of the cycle ergometer ride was 10 minutes. The objective was to reach exercise intensity level 3 according to the RPE scale. The time was steadily increased while maintaining a moderate level of intensity for a minimum of 2 to 3 weeks. The final stage of rehabilitation was the accomplishment of a 35-50-minute ride on the cycle ergometer at a moderate level of intensity. The exercise was carried out until reaching subjective feeling of fatigue (5-6 on the 10 -point Borg scale). The number of evolutions and load were constant, individually tailored to the patient depending on the tolerance of a given exercise. They were as follows: speed regulation from 10 to 60 [RPM], regulation of motor power from 1 to 10 [Nm], and preset therapy duration from 0 to 120 minutes. The parameters were selected in such way that the number of revolutions and the workload made it an endurance type of training. It should be added that the course of training shown on the ergometer screen in the form of a power level achieved [W] for both lower limbs was a motivating factor for the patient to continue with the exercise. Group 3 performed strength (resistance) exercises with weights, balls and Thera Bands. Mostly the lower limbs and one upper limb free of the arteriovenous fistula were engaged. Exercises of the lower limbs included: straightening \/ bending of the knee, straightening \/ bending at the hip, adduction \/ abduction at the hip. Exercises of the upper limbs included: \"rowing\" single-handedly (limb adduction to the body in the sagittal plane); \"squeezing\" with one hand (bending limbs in the shoulder joint in the transverse plane, limb in 90\u00b0 abduction in the coronal plane), bending the forearm at the elbow joint; straightening the forearm in the elbow joint). One exercise in each exercise referral scheme was performed, the workout consisted of 4 - 5 sets; 1 lightweight 20 repetitions, 2-5 main of 10 - 20 reps; until exhaustion. The intensity was determined according to subjective feelings, matching color-coded bands or weights adequately. The intensity was increased by raising the number of sets or repetitions while maintaining the load. In the case when a patient reported tolerance, training load was increased and maintained at a constant level for at least 3 trainings (1 week) in order to adapt to a new load. If the patient showed some progress, the load was increased also in the following week. Only in the case of indisposition was the load reduced, however, at the next training the previous load was restored. Exercise was performed until onset of subjective feelings of exhaustion (at the beginning 5-6 in the 10-point Borg scale), however, not until \u201cmuscle failure\u201d (in order to avoid the risk of injuries in and around tendons, muscle attachments, etc.). Weights used for the lower limbs were: 1.1 kg - 3.7 kg; for upper limbs: 1-3 kg. The duration of the main part was increased gradually from 10 minutes in the initial period of training up to 50 minutes. Resistance training was completed in a seated position. 3) Final part, relaxation, lasted about 5min. and included free active exercises of the lower limbs in recumbent position as well as breathing exercises. Stopping exercises during the training session was allowed in cases where a participant was feeling unwell or fatigued, experienced the onset of muscular, joint or coronary pain, nausea, dizziness or shortness of breath, obtained a heart rate above 80% of maximum (HRmax), exceeded blood pressure values above 200\/110 mmHg or below 110\/50 mmHg, and in the case of incapacity to maintain the recommended exercise pace. For safety reasons, heart rate, blood pressure and the degree of subjective fatigue levels according to the 10-point Borg scale were monitored before, during and after exercise.","PMID":26872253,"Scores":95},{"ProtocolNumber":321,"ProtocolName":"Endurance training","Classification":"Aerobic exercise","Frequency":3,"Intensity ":"Light to moderate","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"RPE(3-6)\/(Borg 0-10)","TimesPerSession":"10-50","Type":"Cycle ergometer","Volume":"60-180","PeriodsOfTime":"In the first 2 hours of hemodialysis","WarmUp":"5min(active exercises of the lower limbs in recumbent position)","CoolDown":"5min(free active exercises of the lower limbs in recumbent position as well as breathing exercises)","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"YES","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"6 months","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Lack of cooperation (mainly due to dementia);Poorly controlled hypertension;Severe symptomatic arrhythmia (causing hypotonia);Acute coronary syndrome in the last 4 weeks;Unstable angina;Heart failure (>II in NYHA grading);Hyperkaliemia (>6 mmol\/l);Hypokaliemia (<3,5 mmol\/l);Severe anemia (Ht <25%);Uncontrolled renal osteodystrophy or osteoporosis confirmed by DEXA;Musculoskeletal deformation;Acute illness (recent fever, pain\/fever of unknown origin).","CombinationTherapy":"NA","Protocol":"Trainings were conducted three times a week for a period of 6 months.

In this part, depending on the training allocated: Group 1 performed endurance training on a MOTOmed letto2cycle ergometer which is a motorized exercise therapy device that has a CE 0124, EMV, ISO Qualit\u00e4tsmanagement safety certificate which enables a patient to ride in a recumbent or reclined position. Training on ergometer concentrates on lower limbs, the position was chosen by the patient according to their comfort and, just as important, to the fluency of dialysis. Training intensity was selected on the basis of subjective feelings of the patient and steadily increased from low to moderate levels based on a 10-point fatigue assessment (Borg scale). This is a reliable indicator for evaluating the intensity of physical exercise, among dialysis patients. In the first week of training the length of the cycle ergometer ride was 10 minutes. The objective was to reach exercise intensity level 3 according to the RPE scale. The time was steadily increased while maintaining a moderate level of intensity for a minimum of 2 to 3 weeks. The final stage of rehabilitation was the accomplishment of a 35-50-minute ride on the cycle ergometer at a moderate level of intensity. The exercise was carried out until reaching subjective feeling of fatigue (5-6 on the 10 -point Borg scale). The number of evolutions and load were constant, individually tailored to the patient depending on the tolerance of a given exercise. They were as follows: speed regulation from 10 to 60 [RPM], regulation of motor power from 1 to 10 [Nm], and preset therapy duration from 0 to 120 minutes. The parameters were selected in such way that the number of revolutions and the workload made it an endurance type of training. It should be added that the course of training shown on the ergometer screen in the form of a power level achieved [W] for both lower limbs was a motivating factor for the patient to continue with the exercise. Group 3 performed strength (resistance) exercises with weights, balls and Thera Bands. Mostly the lower limbs and one upper limb free of the arteriovenous fistula were engaged. Exercises of the lower limbs included: straightening \/ bending of the knee, straightening \/ bending at the hip, adduction \/ abduction at the hip. Exercises of the upper limbs included: \"rowing\" single-handedly (limb adduction to the body in the sagittal plane); \"squeezing\" with one hand (bending limbs in the shoulder joint in the transverse plane, limb in 90\u00b0 abduction in the coronal plane), bending the forearm at the elbow joint; straightening the forearm in the elbow joint). One exercise in each exercise referral scheme was performed, the workout consisted of 4 - 5 sets; 1 lightweight 20 repetitions, 2-5 main of 10 - 20 reps; until exhaustion. The intensity was determined according to subjective feelings, matching color-coded bands or weights adequately. The intensity was increased by raising the number of sets or repetitions while maintaining the load. In the case when a patient reported tolerance, training load was increased and maintained at a constant level for at least 3 trainings (1 week) in order to adapt to a new load. If the patient showed some progress, the load was increased also in the following week. Only in the case of indisposition was the load reduced, however, at the next training the previous load was restored. Exercise was performed until onset of subjective feelings of exhaustion (at the beginning 5-6 in the 10-point Borg scale), however, not until \u201cmuscle failure\u201d (in order to avoid the risk of injuries in and around tendons, muscle attachments, etc.). Weights used for the lower limbs were: 1.1 kg - 3.7 kg; for upper limbs: 1-3 kg. The duration of the main part was increased gradually from 10 minutes in the initial period of training up to 50 minutes. Resistance training was completed in a seated position. 3) Final part, relaxation, lasted about 5min. and included free active exercises of the lower limbs in recumbent position as well as breathing exercises. Stopping exercises during the training session was allowed in cases where a participant was feeling unwell or fatigued, experienced the onset of muscular, joint or coronary pain, nausea, dizziness or shortness of breath, obtained a heart rate above 80% of maximum (HRmax), exceeded blood pressure values above 200\/110 mmHg or below 110\/50 mmHg, and in the case of incapacity to maintain the recommended exercise pace. For safety reasons, heart rate, blood pressure and the degree of subjective fatigue levels according to the 10-point Borg scale were monitored before, during and after exercise.","PMID":26872253,"Scores":95},{"ProtocolNumber":322,"ProtocolName":"Exercise intervention","Classification":"Aerobic exercise","Frequency":3,"Intensity ":"Moderate to vigorous","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"NA","TimesPerSession":30,"Type":"Step aerobics (low-step level), stationary bicycling, or treadmill walking","Volume":180,"PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"10min","CoolDown":"10min(bending to relieve backache, arm reaches, and shoulder circles)","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"12 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Psychiatric or cardiovascular diseases;Risk of preterm labor;Old primigravida;Patients with previous repeated abortion;Polyhydramnios;Oligohydramnios;Persistent bleeding after the first trimester;Uncontrolled thyroid disorder;Placenta previa;Incompetent cervix;History of infertility.

The yoga intervention that was used in this study was based on a gentle version of the Hatha yoga tradition. Hatha yoga is the most widely practiced yoga tradition that is being used in the West. It is referred to as physical yoga. However, it also has some meditative qualities. It uses breath to connect the mind and body. A typical yoga class includes a short meditation, a series of stretches to prepare the body, poses and postures, and a period of relaxation at the end of the session. The participants in the yoga group received 8 weeks (75 minutes per week) of yoga training and completed the same five questionnaires that members of the mindfulness and control groups completed. The participants in the yoga group also received all necessary materials that could assist them to practice at home. They received a yoga mat, a yoga strap, and a journal book to document their home practice. A thumb drive, which included video and verbal instructions of both regular and chair yoga conducted by the instructor, were also given to the participants for practice at home. This ensured that participants did not use advanced instruction in poses and\/or postures   that could have hurt them. The thumb drive also included soft yoga music that a participant could use if he\/she decided to do their home practice based on memory. In the early sessions of the yoga training, simple poses and postures were taught and practiced with the students. As the group progressed, the moderate versions of the poses and postures were introduced to the participants. This strategy allowed the students to practice yoga according to their ability. For safety reasons, the strenuous versions of poses and postures were not taught or practiced.","PMID":27566622,"Scores":50},{"ProtocolNumber":324,"ProtocolName":"High dose exercise","Classification":"Aerobic exercise","Frequency":3,"Intensity ":"Moderate","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"10 kcal\/kg\/week","TimesPerSession":"NA","Type":"Treadmills, cycle ergometers, or a combination of both","Volume":150,"PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"NA","CoolDown":"NA","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"YES","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"1 week(1st week)","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"History, physical examination, or laboratory results indicating a significant medical condition;Depression due to a comorbid psychiatric disorder;Current pharmacologic or formal psychotherapeutic treatment other than SSRI;Treatment resistance, defined as failure of 2 or more pharmacologic treatments of adequate dose and duration during the current depressive episode (as determined by a psychiatrist and by review of the Antidepressant Treatment History Form);Pregnancy or planning a pregnancy in the next year.","CombinationTherapy":"Home-based exercise sessions;Antidepressant medication","Protocol":"Eligible participants (n=126) were randomized to receive augmentation with either a high dose (16 kilocalories per kilogram of body weight [KKW] (n=64) or a low dose (4 KKW) of exercise (n=62).

To confirm that the chosen intensity does not lead to metabolic  overload, capillary blood samples were taken during the very first  training session (always on a bicycle ergometer and lasting 30 min) from the ear lobe at rest, after the warm up phase (after 6 min) and for three times during the last 10 min (at minute 16, 21  and 26) of the exercise phase to achieve a lactate steady state.  During the training period intensity was adjusted according to the  individual heart rate of the first training, blood pressure (maximum 180\/100 mmHg) and subjective perceived exertion using the Borg-scale, which was defined as 13 at maximum.  Workload was  increased by 10% when heart rate and exertion on the Borg-scale  lowered at the appropriate level.  The second workout phase was  performed directly after cycling.  Heart rate was measured via EKG-monitoring. The intensity was adjusted according to heart rate as mentioned above.","PMID":26707353,"Scores":75},{"ProtocolNumber":334,"ProtocolName":"Daily activity program","Classification":"Aerobic exercise","Frequency":"NA","Intensity ":"NA","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"NA","TimesPerSession":20,"Type":"Walking, ball games and stretching  exercises","Volume":"NA","PeriodsOfTime":"Morning","WarmUp":"NA","CoolDown":"NA","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"6 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Acute or chronic infectious disease;Acute or lifetime immunological disorders;Diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2;Lifetime or current cardiovascular disorders;Pregnancy;Schizophrenia;Mental retardation;Bipolar disorder;Current substance abuse or dependency;Age younger than 18 years.","CombinationTherapy":"Psychotherapy;Cognitive behavioral therapy;Antidepressant medication","Protocol":"Patients in the control group (CTRL) were allowed to take part  in the daily activity program of the ward consisting of supervised  activation in the morning (walking, ball games and stretching  exercises for 20 min).","PMID":26707353,"Scores":75},{"ProtocolNumber":335,"ProtocolName":"Structured aerobic training program","Classification":"Aerobic exercise","Frequency":3,"Intensity ":"NA","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"HR;RPEmax(13-14)\/(Borg 6-20)","TimesPerSession":45,"Type":"Bicycle ergometer(25min);Cross-trainer,Stepper,Arm ergometer,Treadmill,Recumbent ergometer, or a rowing ergometer(20min)","Volume":135,"PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"NA","CoolDown":"NA","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"6 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Present cardiovascular illnesses;Type I or type II diabetes mellitus;Acute or chronic infection illnesses;Tumors;Pregnancy;Anemia;Schizophrenia;Substance use disorders;Orthopedic and neurological diseases that limit the implementation of bicycle ergometry.","CombinationTherapy":"Antidepressant medication","Protocol":"During inpatient treatment, three training units were performed per week, with each session lasting 45 min (with at least 1 day break between the units), for 6 weeks.

For moderate intensity initially 50% of the maximum workload achieved in the incremental exercise test was chosen. At this intensity it is assumed that patients train in the aerobic-anaerobic transition zone (above the VAT and below the anaerobic lactate threshold). To confirm that the chosen intensity leads to no overload capillary blood samples were taken during the very first training session (always on a bicycle ergometer and lasting 30 minutes) from the ear lobe at rest, after the warm up phase (after 6 minutes) and for three times during the last ten minutes (at minute 16, 21 and 26) of the exercise phase to investigate if there is a lactate steady state as a sign of no overload.  An increase of blood lactate of not more than 0.5 mmol\/l between minute 16 and 26 was defined as lactate steady state. All tested patients were in a lactate steady state.  During the training period intensity was adjusted according to heart rate of the first training, blood pressure (maximum 180\/100 mmHg) and subjective perceived exertion using the Borg-scale, which should be 13 at maximum.  Workload was increased by 10% when heart rate and exertion on the Borg-scale lowered at the appropriate level.  The second workout phase was performed directly after cycling. Heart rate was measured via EKG-monitoring. The exercise training started with a 25 minute workout phase on a bicycle ergometer with 60 to 70 revolutions per minute. Training was continued at personal preference for 20 minutes on a crosstrainer, stepper, arm ergometry, treadmill, recumbent or a rowing ergometry. The training heart rate was allowed to be a maximum of 10% above the average heart rate on the bicycle ergometer for all devices except for the recumbent  (same pulse rate) and the arm ergometry (here the pulse rate should be about 10% lower).  The intensity was adjusted according to heart rate as mentioned above.

The subjects were then guided through any one of these meditation practices for next 30 min. This included focusing awareness on sounds and chants from Vedic texts, or breath awareness and impulses of touch emanating from palms and fingers while practicing yogic mudras, or a dynamic form of meditation which involved practice with eyes closed of four yoga postures interspersed with relaxation while supine, thus achieving a combination of both \u201cstimulating\u201d and \u201ccalming,\u201d practice. The participants were also informed about practical day-to-day application of awareness and relaxation to attain a state of equanimity during stressful situations and were given homework in learning to adapt to such situations by applying these principles. Subjects were provided audiotapes of these practices for home practice using the instructors voice so that a familiar voice could be heard on the cassette. Subjects underwent in person sessions during their hospital visits and stay and were asked to practice at home on remaining days. Their instructors through telephone calls, weekly house visits, and daily logs monitored their home practice on a day-to-day basis. The subjects were required to practice yoga for 1 h at least thrice a week. One yoga therapist and one trained counselor were involved in imparting their respective interventions.","PMID":26009671,"Scores":70},{"ProtocolNumber":409,"ProtocolName":"Progressive aerobic and resistance exercise training program","Classification":"Aerobic exercise","Frequency":3,"Intensity ":"Moderate to vigorous","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"%HRmax(60-80)","TimesPerSession":30,"Type":"Treadmill","Volume":165,"PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"5min","CoolDown":"5min(stretching)","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"YES","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"8 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Exhibited medical impairment that compromised their safety as a participant, met criteria for opiate dependence, or had a psychiatric impairment that warranted hospitalization or primary treatment:Clinically significant heart disease or hypertension;Unstable pulmonary or cardiovascular disease that would interfere with participation in exercise regimen;Neurological or psychiatric disorder as assessed by MINI or clinical interview, such as psychosis, bipolar illness, Tourette\u2019s syndrome, major depression, organic brain disease, dementia, that would require ongoing treatment make study compliance difficult;Musculoskeletal disease that would prevent participation in exercise regimen;Baseline ECG showing evidence of clinically significant abnormalities;Untreated or unstable medical illness including: neuroendocrine, autoimmune, renal, hepatic, or active infectious disease (other than HIV) that requires immediate medical attention;Clinically significant abnormalities in hematology and chemistry laboratory tests that may make participation hazardous;HIV positive and unable to obtain a clearance for participation from medical care provider;Currently pregnant;Any other illness, condition, or use of medications that, in the opinion of the PI and\/or the study physician, would preclude safe participation or completion of the study.","CombinationTherapy":"NA","Protocol":"The exercise intervention consisted of a progressive aerobic and resistance exercise training program that was conducted with participants three days a week during the 8-week trial (totaling 24 sessions).

In mid-pregnancy, women again completed all procedures as described above and answered questionnaires assessing changes in health and behaviors since early in pregnancy. Within two months after delivery, women were mailed a questionnaire inquiring about past-week depressive symptoms. Thus, yoga group participants were assessed on five occasions: twice each in early and mid-pregnancy, and once within two months of delivery.

Depending on the group, each session included 30 min of cognitive training and 45 min of either physical  exercise or relaxation. The physical exercise was led by a trained physical exercise instructor, with previous experience in working with psychiatric patients. Cognitive training and relaxation were conducted by trained psychologists. All groups of the intervention program consisted of between eight and twelve participants per session. Each physical exercise session consisted of three phases,  starting with a warm-up (10 min), followed by cardio training (25 min) and ending with a cool-down phase (10 min), lasting altogether 45 min. The warm-up consisted of pep rally, ball games, stretching and motivation  exercises.  The cardio training included aerobic exercise,  aerobic with boxing and circuit training in alternate  order.  The instructors ensured that the training intensity  was set at an aerobic endurance level of 60\u201370% of  individual maximum heart rate, which was calculated  individually for each participant using the maximum  heart rates of the ECG.  Heart rate of each participant was measured by instructors every 10 min during  the training sessions.  The exercise equipment for the  circuit training used in this study included a trampoline,  weights, physiotherapy balls, staves and flexi bars.  The  circuit training comprised six different \u2018circuit stations\u2019  focusing on arms, legs, chest, back, shoulders and  abdomen.  It included endurance exercise with and  without weights and other materials, with 2\u20133 circuits  per training per participant.  Each exercise had to be  performed for 60 s with a break of 20 s.  The exercises  were arranged to be comparable, but adjusted to the  individual level of the participants.  The aerobic training comprised exercises for arms and  legs and included boxing elements and learning step rates.  First, the aerobic training started with easy arms and legs  movement (without any choreography).  During the intervention phase, the exercises became more difficult, e.g.,  through combined arms and legs exercises or through  building a small choreography (e.g., arms \u2013 legs -  arms \uff0b legs - arm, etc.).  To ensure that all participants  were able to do the aerobic exercises, the choreography  was simple and was repeated as often as necessary by the  instructor.  The aerobic training with boxing comprised the  same order than the simple aerobic training, but included  special boxing elements.  The cool-down phase included  stretching and slow-motion exercising. Both intervention groups received three sessions a week of cognitive training, lasting 30 min each. After a break of approximately 10 min, the intervention was followed by physical exercise or relaxation.","PMID":24487666,"Scores":100},{"ProtocolNumber":444,"ProtocolName":"Individualised exercise programme","Classification":"Aerobic exercise","Frequency":5,"Intensity ":"Moderate or vigorous","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"RPE","TimesPerSession":30,"Type":"Swimming;Walking;Cycling","Volume":150,"PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"Yes","CoolDown":"Yes","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"12 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"NA","ExerciseContraindications":"Reported suicide intent, delusions or hallucinations, concurrent alcohol or substance abuse or dependency;Medical condition or locomotion difficulties that would preclude participation  in a physical activity programme.","CombinationTherapy":"Usual medical care","Protocol":"Guidelines are to complete aerobic (cardiorespiratory) activity of moderate intensity at least 5 days\/week or of vigorous intensity a minimum of 3 days\/week.

Before each session, a warm-up of 5 minutes, moving the main joints to be used during the session, and 5 minutes of stretching were performed. At the end of sessions, participants performed 5 minutes of cool-down exercises at noncontrolled  intensities. The progression of water resistance training was ensured by varying  the number of sets and the duration, and, consequently, the total time  of exercise for each muscle group during the 12 weeks was maintained (1 minute per muscle group). The resistance exercises were separated into  two blocks: each block had one exercise for the lower limbs and one  exercise for the upper limbs. The number of sets of each block changed  at every four weeks. Block 1, performed first, consisted of elbow flexion  and extension (bilaterally) and right or left hip flexion and extension (unilaterally). Additionally, block 2 consisted of shoulder flexion and extension (bilaterally) and right or left knee flexion and extension (starting from hip  flexion at 90\u00b0; unilaterally). In the first 4 weeks, each block included 3 sets  of 20 seconds for each exercise in the following sequence: 20 seconds of  continuous bilateral upper extremity flexion\/extension, 5 seconds of rest, 20 seconds of unilateral (right side) lower extremity flexion\/extension, 5 seconds of rest, and 20 seconds of unilateral (left side) lower extremity  flexion\/extension. This sequence was repeated 3 times with an active  interval (stationary running for 80 seconds) between each set. In the  next 4 weeks, each block included 4 sets of 15 seconds with an active  interval (stationary running for 90 seconds) between each set. In the last 4 weeks, each block included 6 sets of 10 seconds with an active interval (stationary running for 100 seconds) between each set. The resistance  training sessions lasted for 13 minutes and 20 seconds in the first 4 weeks, 16 minutes and 50 seconds in the following 4 weeks, and 28 minutes and 20 seconds in the last 4 weeks. The water-based aerobic exercises were performed at the heart  rate corresponding to the second ventilatory threshold (VT2) determined  during maximum VO2 test. During weeks 1\u20134, participants performed 2 sets of 3 minutes for each exercise with the following sequence: 3 minutes of stationary running, 3 minutes of cross-country skiing, and 3 minutes of frontal kick with no interval between sets.

The 75-minute group gentle Hatha yoga class was taught by experienced yoga teachers familiar with teaching yoga-na\u00efve students. The fundamental aspects of the group yoga classes are as follows: (a) creation of a safe space and empowerment to adapt practice according to the mood, (b) intention setting with weekly themes, (c) pranayama (breathing practices), (d) asana (physical practices), and (e) yoga nidra (guided meditation) and savasana (relaxation). The safe space was created at the beginning of every class by the yoga teachers, who reminded participants to modify or stop any poses or activities that were uncomfortable and\/or to try something new. In addition, considering that most depressed individuals experience the symptoms of depression to be neither predictable nor consistent from day to day, participants in this study were encouraged to use yogic practices in a way that best met their daily needs, which differentiates this yoga intervention from others in the literature that do not account for individual mood differences. To help participants focus on key aspects of the yoga intervention, every week had a theme such as self-care, finding balance, mindfulness, and others. Pranayama, or breathing practices, taught conscious regulation of the breath, with specific patterns designed to induce a sense of calm, well-being, stress tolerance, and mental focus. Gentle physical poses, asanas, were introduced with simple directive language and permission to adapt as needed; the level of difficulty of the poses increased slightly over the 8-week series of classes. Every yoga class ended with yoga nidra and savasana (guided meditation and relaxation). To prevent distraction from intrusive thoughts, periods of silence were kept initially to a minimum during savasana, with slowly increasing lengths of silence over the course of the sessions. The home practices were guided by two resources for participants: (1) a DVD designed to allow them to individually adapt their daily yoga practice according to their current mood by picking from multiple 10-minute segments from the DVD menu, and (2) class handouts provided after every class with themes, quotes, pictures, and descriptions of the yoga poses practiced that week.","PMID":23706890,"Scores":70},{"ProtocolNumber":465,"ProtocolName":"Structured Iyengar yoga intervention","Classification":"Yoga","Frequency":"\u22652","Intensity ":"NA","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"NA","TimesPerSession":60,"Type":"Pranayamas;Warm-up exercises;Asanas;Relaxation exercises","Volume":"\u2265120","PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"NA","CoolDown":"NA","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"3 months","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"History of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation within 3 months;Contraindications for yoga training;Life expectancy <1 year;Advanced heart failure.","CombinationTherapy":"Encouraged to practice yoga on their own at home on a daily basis","Protocol":"During the intervention period, all patients underwent the structured Iyengar yoga training at least twice weekly.

Both  protocols lasted 10 weeks, and 30 sessions (1-h sessions) in total were performed 3 times a week under the direct supervision of physical therapists. During this period, the participants were  instructed to maintain their usual activities and to refrain from  initiating other physical exercise programs. The AE protocol consisted of a 5-minute warm-up followed by 40 minutes of AE, including walking and free exercises (calisthenics exercises) for both the upper and lower limbs and a 5-minute cool-down period, as recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine. The heart rate was maintained at 60% of age-predicted maximum heart rate during both the warmup and cool-down periods, and it was maintained between 65%  and 80% of the maximum during the aerobic activity.  The work  overload (movement speed, walking speed) was progressively  increased so that the heart rate was maintained within training  range.  The participants were monitored throughout the session by  a heart rate meter to guarantee the proper intervention zone.  The  aerobic exercise was conducted in a sport hall, outside.  With regard to exercise specificity, to assess the responses to  training, we defined lower-limb muscle strength as an outcome  measure for the SE group by using an isokinetic dynamometerb  assessment and the distance walked during the 6-minute walk  test for the AE group.","PMID":23602881,"Scores":90},{"ProtocolNumber":470,"ProtocolName":"Aerobic exercise augmentation","Classification":"Aerobic exercise","Frequency":3,"Intensity ":"Light","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"4 kcal\/kg\/week","TimesPerSession":"NA","Type":"Treadmills;Cycle ergometers","Volume":"NA","PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"NA","CoolDown":"NA","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"1 week(1st week)","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"NA","CombinationTherapy":"Antidepressant medication(SSRI)","Protocol":"Participants received augmentation treatment with  either a public health dose [16 kilocalories per kilogram of bodyweight (KKW)] or a low dose (4 KKW) of  aerobic exercise for 12 weeks.

These asanas done with internal awareness (eyes closed) promotes  full range of motion of the body part by graded gradually increasing  stretches followed by relaxation, that results in flexibility of the  joints and strengthening of the muscles.  The breathing techniques (Pranayama) focus on conscious prolongation of all three components of breathing cycle (inhalation, effortless retention, and  exhalation) that results in better vital capacity and balance of vital  energy.

This is further elaborated through four themes (I Self-image, II Balance, III Strength, and IV Boundaries) which form  the basis of eight two-hour sessions. Psycho-education is based on the Coping with Depression  course and addresses factors for depression such as constructive  thinking, social skills, self-esteem, and pleasant activities. The exercise component is performed at a low to moderate  intensity for 60 min and employs stretching, strength exercises to reinforce muscle resistance, flexibility, body focused exercise (bodywork techniques to improve posture and awareness of the  mind-body connection) and relaxation.  Since low-SES women do  not commonly have intense exercise habits, the physical exercise was designed not to be  much more strenuous than their habitual level of exercise to avoid  negative feelings combined with exhaustion.  One of  the most important elements within the EWW course is that each  session coordinates the psycho-education and exercise components as far as possible with the aim of reciprocally reinforcing  these intervention themes.  This means that participants not only  talk about a topic, but also experience it through the exercises. Each session was led by two  trainers, a licensed psychologist or mental health provider and an  exercise professional such as a physical therapist or licensed sports  instructor.  The trainers provide positive feedback to enhance participants\u2019 self-esteem and confidence.

Each exercise session included the following sequence of steps:1.Before starting the exercise, resting heart rate was measured by the participants from the wrist pulse. Aerobic exercise commenced with a \u201cwarm up,\u201d followed by dynamic stretching, concentrating on breathing and then continued with slow jogging (10 minutes). 2.In the next phase of the exercise which took 30 to 35 minutes, the movements were performed with higher intensity in the range of 60% to 80% of maximal heart rate. This step included faster unilateral and bilateral hands and feet movements. Some exercise equipments such as bench, box, ball, wooden stick, and weight were used by participants in this regard. Heart rate was measured and recorded after this step (Active heart rate). 3.In the third step, the intensity of movements was decreased, and movements were carried out on mat which included static stretching and muscle relaxation.

","CombinationTherapy":"Cognitive behavioural therapy","Protocol":"The interdisciplinary intervention was comprised of manualized cognitive behavioural therapy(CBT) and community-based aerobic activity based on the Lifestyle Intervention arm of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The exercise intervention consisted of 12 weeks of community-based exercise in which participants were encouraged to engage in 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week. To facilitate safe exercise practice, six exercise classes with supervision by trained exercise physiologists were provided to participants in conjunction with free passes to partnering community exercise facilities over the 12-week intervention period. In addition, participants had weekly contact with study personnel to encourage adherence to the exercise protocol and monitor safety. To provide participants with the necessary training to begin a safe exercise program, one exercise class per week was offered in weeks 1\u20134, 6, and 8. In session 1, participants were introduced to exercising safety, including recognition of hypoglycemia and monitoring of blood glucose before initiating a new exercise bout, proper use of exercise equipment, and individual exercise prescriptions generated from the graded exercise test (GXT) at baseline, with aerobic intensity established at 55\u201365% of their maximal heart rate response. The intensity of exercise progressed to 65\u201375% of their maximal heart rate response at the baseline GXT at either week 4 or week 6 based on exercise tolerance (ability to complete 30 minutes of continuous aerobic exercise in the established range). During the baseline assessment and throughout the exercise classes, participants were trained to use the Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) in conjunction with heart rate monitors to assess exercise tolerance. Over the course of each class, participants were monitored for up to 60 minutes of exercise by an exercise physiology graduate student, M. Kushnick, or a community fitness instructor. Participants were trained to exercise in a manner consistent with the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommendations, including 10 minutes of pre-activity (warm-up and stretching); up to 30 minutes of active exercise (endurance; initially beginning at 20 minutes and typically progressing to 30 minutes by week 4); and 10 minutes of post-activity (cool-down, recovery). One-on-one exercise monitoring was available to participants who received feedback throughout the session on their intensity for each activity. During each class, participants were given personalized instruction on proper and safe warm-up, form, intensity, and cool-down of exercise procedures. Exercise modes available during these sessions included walking on an indoor track or using treadmills, stationary recumbent\/upright bicycles, or elliptical machines. Participants were provided with passes to the exercise venues for use between and beyond exercise classes for the duration of the intervention period. Exercise goals were adapted from the DPP to accommodate the physical and medical restrictions endemic to an older-adult diabetic population. Exercise prescriptions were based on the results obtained from the GXT obtained at baseline. Participants were given exercise goals that represented a total duration of 150 minutes per week with activity that reached 50\u201385% maximum heart rate consistent with recommendations from the ACSM. Because of the paucity of previous exercise experience of participants in this region, as well as the unique needs of patients with depression and diabetes, exercise duration and intensity goals were increased in a graduated manner during weeks 1\u20133, beginning with 100 minutes of weekly exercise and increasing to 150 minutes of weekly exercise. Participants recorded the type (e.g., walking, swimming, or stationary cycling) and format (e.g., solitary activity or exercise with a partner\/spouse\/family member) of activities each week. CBT sessions were conducted by advanced graduate students in the doctoral program in clinical psychology at Ohio University who received training in the manualized approach under the supervision of the author (MdG). Participants received 10 sessions of individual therapy in which they designated treatment goals tailored to their needs.","PMID":22350739,"Scores":85},{"ProtocolNumber":485,"ProtocolName":"Exercise-only intervention","Classification":"Aerobic exercise;Resistance exercise","Frequency":6,"Intensity ":"NA","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"NA","TimesPerSession":50,"Type":"Pin-loaded resistance machines;Bicycle or upper limb ergometer","Volume":300,"PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"NA","CoolDown":"NA","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"6 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Suffered from other movement disorders in addition to hemiparesis;Unable to follow two-step verbal commands.","CombinationTherapy":"NA","Protocol":"Participants in the exercise-only group (EX) and yoga-and-exercise group (YEX) groups both attended six weekly 50-minute exercise classes that the CPAA\u2019s clinical exercise physiologist staff delivered.

An accredited yoga teacher, with whom the research team signed a contract for the purpose of the study, conducted the group yoga classes. The research team scheduled those classes on   an alternate day from the group exercise classes. Each class commenced with a 10-minute didactic activity that the teacher presented on yoga-relevant topics such as safety, practice modification, and aims. After the introduction, the class involved a hatha yoga component with approximately 30 minutes of modified asana practice involving gentle and slow movements and 5 minutes of pranayama practice involving gentle breathing with concentrated attention. Although the study did not individualize the hatha yoga asana   component for individual participants, the research team designed each of the six group classes to introduce new practices progressively, increasing the number of rounds and encouraging awareness of movement and body sensations. Moreover, the yoga asanas maintained the progressive nature of the class through modification of the basic asanas to suit participants\u2019 willingness to challenge themselves and their functional capacities. For example, the   teacher demonstrated unilateral modification of movement, encouraged visualization for increased range of motion and permitted participants to use chairs and walls as supports during some of the asanas. After the participants were familiar with the asanas, the instructor taught them to combine gentle breathing techniques with the movements to progress awareness and development further. Following the hatha yoga component, the yoga teacher provided a verbally guided 30-minute meditation practice called  Satyananda yoga nidra. Participants could practice this meditation either while seated in a chair or lying in a supine position on a yoga mat on the floor, depending on their preferences. The  Satyananda yoga nidra involved a series of verbally guided stages including brief relaxation, mental awareness of body-region sen-sations, natural-breath awareness, and mental repetition of a personally chosen goal.  The end of the class involved a 15-minute group discussion on topics related to the yoga program or personal experiences of it.

All pieces of exercise equipment had surfaces on which to put a book or magazine, so reading was allowed. One participant brought his laptop and watched online television programs during his exercise session. Listening to music was the most common activity. Participants were encouraged to warm up slowly, to try all exercise equipment and develop their own preferences, and to increase the length of their workouts gradually. Each participant was asked to exercise for at least 30 minutes in the first supervised session and to exercise for 45 to 60 minutes by the second or third session and thereafter. Heart rates were recorded every 10 minutes using the Polar F55 BRO model heart rate monitor.

Initially in this study, there was an expectation that working out on the available equipment (treadmill, elliptical, and stationary bike) would lead to an aerobic exercise session for participants. However, after six participants completed the 12-week intervention, it became apparent that the intensity of the supervised exercise varied greatly among the adolescents. It was determined that a target heart rate would be established for each participant. The algorithm used was 220 minus age, multiplied by 0.85.

Exercise consisted of 30-45 min\/day walks, 5 days\/week, for 12 weeks. Of the 5 walks per week, 1  was supervised and the other 4 unsupervised.  The supervised  weekly walk took place at the Hospital Gymnasium, on a treadmill  set to 5 km\/h, with an inclination of 0\u00b0 , in the presence of a Physical Training Teacher.  These sessions were not only measured by  treadmill speed but also by the GT1M accelerometer.  Accelerometer counts above 1952 per minute are considered moderate, and we have evaluated those counts during the exercise session.  The  chosen speed of 5 km\/h was due to the fact that some studies have reported that, on average, speeds above 4.8 km\/h will represent around 12.8-13.9 ml\/kg\/min or 3.7-4 METs, which is in accordance  with the >3 METs needed for the exercise to be considered  moderate.  During these sessions, participants were taught walking  and behavioral techniques.  Behavioral techniques focused on reminding the participant to exercise by placing the tennis shoes at  the door entrance, leave a note at the main door reminding them to  walk, and use cell phone reminders with a specific tone ring.  Social strategies were also adopted, not only be the gymnasium technicians and the doctors, that always stressed the importance of  complying with the exercise program, but also by asking the  participants\u2019 family members to be involved in the process. At the end of each session, participants were asked by the  teacher to perform the remaining 4 walks of that week where they  felt more comfortable, trying to reach the same exercise intensity of  the treadmill walk. In order to have a measure of the subjective  intensity of exercise, a rate of perceived exertion was used:  participants were asked to walk in a way that would increase their  respiration and perspiration, but without reaching shortness of  breath. All individuals wore an ActiGraph\u00aeGT1M LLC two-dimensional accelerometer permanently during the 12 week study period, except when they were sleeping.

The program includes four phases: (a) warm-up (20 min): eight postures  to loosen up the body structure, (b) hatha yoga (20 min):  seven gentle stretching postures to increase range of  motion and progressive muscle relaxation in older adults  with special consideration for their physical abilities and  tolerances, (c) relaxation (10 min): three activities to rest the body, and (d) guided-imagery meditation (15 min): two  imagery-guiding directions to facilitate a state of relaxation. A 5-min break is arranged between the warm-up  and hatha yoga phases to accommodate the physical  tolerance of elders. The entire program takes about 70 min  to complete. Abdominal breathing is emphasized in each  program phase. Silver yoga program postures are considered  less strenuous than those used in traditional yoga. Participants in the intervention group were divided into  three groups of about 12 to 13 participants per group. Each group intervention was led by two certified silver  yoga instructors, three times a week for 6 months. Referencing previous research experience, the certified instructors selected were  female adult volunteers, aged 48-60 years. To ensure intervention consistency  across intervention groups and interrater reliability among  instructors, a prerecorded tape made by the principal investigator verbally guided the intervention process and  directed participants in performing each yoga posture. It  was emphasized in the program that each posture was to be  done gently and in moderation. Signs or symptoms of discomfort that occurred during any yoga session were required  to be recorded by instructors. No such signs or symptoms  occurred during any of the sessions.

The purpose  of the program was to improve lower-limb strength,  balance and gait ability.  The HIFE Program includes 41 exercises with examples of how to increase the  difficulty or the load in each exercise.  A PT selected and instructed appropriate exercises for each participant, and also adjusted them to meet changes in health  and functional status. The exercises were based on  functional tasks that are common in everyday life and  were performed in weight-bearing positions. Examples  of these exercises are walking, walking over obstacles,  squats, and turning the trunk and head while standing.  It was recommended in each session that every  participant performed at least two lower-limb strength and two balance exercises in two sets. The participants  were encouraged to perform the exercises at a high  intensity by progressively increasing the load in the  lower-limb strength exercises and the difficulty in the  balance exercises. Strength exercises were intended to  be performed at eight\u201312 repetition maximum (RM).The load was increased by adjusting  the performance of the exercise (e.g. by doing deeper  squats or step-ups onto a higher box) or by using a  weighted belt worn around the waist loaded with  increasing weight (maximum 12 kg). The balance  exercises were intended to fully challenge the participant\u2019s postural stability. The difficulty in each exercise  was increased, for example, by standing or walking on  a narrower base of support or on a more challenging  surface. At the end of the three month exercise period,  the PTs introduced physical tasks for the participants,  in cooperation with a staff member at the facility, for  the purpose of maintaining physical function. The  tasks were integrated into daily life activities. They  were individually recommended according to each  participant\u2019s functional deficits and motivation regarding type (e.g., walking, squats, and standing without  balance support), number (one to four), and frequency (weekly up to daily). The tasks were followed-up after  three months (at the six month follow-up), by interviewing staff about compliance during the preceding  two weeks. The exercise and the control activity were performed in groups of three\u2013nine participants, supervised  by two PTs and one occupational therapist (OT), respectively.  The sessions  lasted approximately 45 min and five sessions were held  in each two week period, giving a total of 29 sessions  over three months (13 weeks).","PMID":20496181,"Scores":80},{"ProtocolNumber":528,"ProtocolName":"Aerobic training","Classification":"Aerobic exercise","Frequency":2,"Intensity ":"Moderate","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"%VO2max(60);HR;RPE","TimesPerSession":20,"Type":"Treadmill walking","Volume":70,"PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"10min;%VO2max(40)","CoolDown":"5min","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"12 months","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Any psychiatric comorbidity","CombinationTherapy":"Antidepressant medication","Protocol":"Each aerobic session began with a 10-min warm-up period (40% VO2max), followed by 20 min of continuous treadmill walking at an intensity corresponding to 60% VO2max.

Two instructors were present at each yoga session: one instructor  followed the pre-recorded tape of the program and demonstrated the yoga postures;  the other instructor adjusted  participants\u2019 postures and prevented any possible harm to  the participants from the yoga exercises.  It was emphasized  in the program that each posture was to be done gently and in  moderation.  The instructors constantly reminded the participants not to strain themselves in any harmful manner while  doing yoga postures.  Any signs and symptoms of discomfort  that occurred during any yoga session were required to be  recorded by the instructors;  no special concerns occurred.","PMID":18947826,"Scores":70},{"ProtocolNumber":539,"ProtocolName":"Home-based individualized exercise program","Classification":"Aerobic exercise;Resistance exercise;Flexibility exercise","Frequency":"NA","Intensity ":"Moderate to vigorous","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"%HRmax(60-85)","TimesPerSession":"NA","Type":"NA","Volume":"60-120","PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"Yes","CoolDown":"Yes","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"YES","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"12 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"NA","ExerciseContraindications":"Current alcohol or substance abuse;Obstetrical or concomitant diseases.","CombinationTherapy":"NA","Protocol":"Participants assigned to the exercise group met four times with the same exercise  physiologist.

These modes of exercise were  chosen to allow precise estimation of total calories  expended for each session. Exercise intensity was  self-selected and held constant throughout an entire  exercise session but could be changed between sessions according to participant preference. Current public health recommendations state that  all adults should perform 30 minutes or more of moderate intensity physical activity on most days of the  week or expend at least 1,000 kilocalories (kcal) weekly. Thus, the exercise dose for energy expenditure  was 16 kcal\/kg\/wk (KKW) to approximate the public  health dose.

Sessions were continuous and initially lasted for 20 minutes being gradually increased up to a maximum of 60 on an ergometric cycle, which was prescribed after the ergospirometric evaluation of variations in the subjects' heart rates. In all sessions subjects had their arterial pressure checked and their heart frequency monitored at 5-second intervals using a Polar\u00ae Advantage NV. Intensiveness of exercise was prescribed according to the concept of an \"anaerobic threshold\" proposed by Wasserman and Mac Ilroy (1964) and Wasserman et al. (1986), who suggested that at a certain percentage of maximal power output, oxygen supply will be insufficient for full oxidation of glucose via the glycolytic pathways, resulting in a displacement of pyruvate which is derived from the Krebs cycle and transformed into lactate. The measurement of ventilation, oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2), during exercise can detect this 'threshold' or 'ventilatory threshold I (VT-I)', which is indicated by a change in the slope of the ventilatory flow rate (VE) plotted against power. This threshold is usually found between 50 and 60% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max). Further, a second 'threshold' was also described between 80 and 90% of VO2 max, when the VE\/VO2 ratio suddenly increases, being interpreted as the 'onset of blood lactate-induced acidosis'.","PMID":16358106,"Scores":100},{"ProtocolNumber":587,"ProtocolName":"Aerobic exercise session","Classification":"Aerobic exercise","Frequency":"NA","Intensity ":"Moderate","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"%HRmax(60-70);RPE","TimesPerSession":30,"Type":"Brisk walking on a treadmill ","Volume":30,"PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"NA","CoolDown":"NA","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"30min","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Intolerant or resistant to exercise;Principal psychiatric diagnosis other than MDD, with a comorbid disorder (e.g., panic disorder);Currently taking antidepressant medication.","CombinationTherapy":"NA","Protocol":"Participants assigned to the aerobic exercise session engaged in one session of brisk walking on a treadmill for 30 min.

Each session lasted 45 min and consisted of a warming-up with stretching exercises, the actual exercise and a cooling-down phase including repeated stretching. During the sessions, the psychomotor therapists carefully verified whether the exercise intensity was comfortable in order to avoid pain, discomfort and excessive fatigue. They followed the program with exercise cards and provided regular progress feedback to the patients. The therapists avoided between-patient comparisons.

Electrodes are also placed in the region of the common peroneal nerve to produce a flexion withdrawal reflex of the leg, triggering the stepping action.  The stimulation unit is connected to a standard aluminum frame walker that has push-button switches mounted on the handles to permit the user to control stand and sit functions, step activation, and stimulation intensity.  Some participants used a standard (ie, \"off the shelf\") ankle-foot orthosis to increase ankle stability and achieve adequate dorsiflexion.

The intervals of 70 sec. per exercise allowed clients to make two circuits in 21 min. without tiring at a particular exercise. At each station(except the bicycle, stepper, and abdominal crunch machine) the clients performed 15 repetitions at 50% of the maximum weight lifted during the preliminary strength test. At the bicycle, stepper, and abdominal crunch machine, the clients performed the exercise continuously throughout the interval.","PMID":7675585,"Scores":100},{"ProtocolNumber":638,"ProtocolName":"Bodybuilding program","Classification":"Resistance exercise","Frequency":3,"Intensity ":"Vigorous","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"%10-RM(70);%20-RM(50)(abdominal crunch)","TimesPerSession":"20-30","Type":"Bench press, leg curl, lat pull, leg press, abdominal crunch, incline press, arm curl, seated row, triceps extension, and toe press","Volume":"90-120","PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"5min","CoolDown":"5min","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"60-90s","Duration":"4 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"NA","CombinationTherapy":"NA","Protocol":"Subjects exercised three times per week under the supervision of the staff and an investigator.

Bodybuilding program-The objective of the bodybuilding program was to exercise sequentially all major muscle groups against heavy weight resistance with rest intervals between exercises. The members of the bodybuilding group were divided into dyads\/triads as a practical necessity because there were not enough exercise stations to accommodate all of the bodybuilders during each exercise session. Bodybuilding subjects, unlike the subjects in aerobics and circuit training, were required to rest between exercises. Anaerobic exercise results in lactic acid build-up which must be dissipated during rest between exercises. Without this rest period, muscles will fatigue and will be unable to recover sufficiently to continue exercise. This rest period conveniently enabled bodybuilders to take turns with their assigned partners on each apparatus.  Subjects in the bodybuilding group performed three sets of the following 10 exercises: bench press, leg curl, lat pull, leg press, abdominal crunch, incline press, arm curl, seated row, triceps extension, and toe press. All exercises were performed at 70% of maximum weight lifted during preliminary   strength test for 10 repetitions per set except the abdominal crunch which was performed at 50% maximum weight for 20 repetitions per set.

The students met a total of 14 times in seven weeks.  The independent variable for this study was type of exercise.  This was comprised of three different levels and included aerobic exercise, nonaerobic exercise, and general education, a no-exercise control. The aerobic exercise condition involved subjects participating in a structured \"Swimming for Fitness\" class designed to increase cardiovascular efficiency.  Each class session involved approximately a  10-min. period of warm-up exercises followed by a 60-min, period of swimming, and concluded with a 10-min.  cool-down routine, to allow for the blood to slowly return to its normal flow, as recommended by Cooper. Numerous laps were swum for several minutes with onIy short breaks in between.  As fitness of the group improved, the number of laps completed and the length of time swimming was increased. Students were taught how to monitor their own heart rates. To ensure improvements in aerobic capacity, heart rate should measure up to its optimal training zone for at least fifteen to twenty minutes.  Target heart rate varies individually, so each student was trained to assess their own zone prior to initiation of the treatment. Therefore, aerobic exercise was defined as that exercise which resulted in heart rates between specified parameters for at least 20 minutes. To calculate target heart rate, the subject's age is subtracted from the number 220 and then multiplied by  .70 and by .85. Exercise below 70% of target heart rate is reported not to   produce significant benefits, while exercising over 85% can overstress the cardiovascular system. Heart rates were taken by having students place the index finger lightly on the radial artery or on the carotid artery immediately after the exercise was stopped. The number of beats in 10 sec. was multiplied by six. If pulse rates did not fall within the target heart-zone exercise was adjusted accordingly.","PMID":1561044,"Scores":75},{"ProtocolNumber":640,"ProtocolName":"Progressive resistance training exercises","Classification":"Resistance exercise","Frequency":2,"Intensity ":"NA","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"NA","TimesPerSession":60,"Type":"Free weights;Universal machines","Volume":160,"PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"10min","CoolDown":"10min","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"YES","IntertrialInterval":"1-3min","Duration":"7 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"NA","ExerciseContraindications":"NA","CombinationTherapy":"NA","Protocol":"The nonaerobic exercise condition required subjects to engage in the structured Progressive Resistance Training Exercises (P.R.E.) using both free weights and Universal machines.

The method of Kundalini Yoga includes certain  Yogic procedures i.e. Asanas, Pranayamas and concentration at various Chakras which is as follows: (1) Asana:  i) Savasana (5 min) : In this Asana, one lies down on the floor with arms at the sides, palms facing upwards  and feet slightly apart to a comfortable position. Thereafter, the volunteer is adviced to close his eyes, relax the whole body, breath in a rhythmic and natural way by counting the breaths \u2013 1 in, 1 out, 2   in \u2013 2 out and so on, and finally controls his thoughts and emotions and relaxes his mind. ii) Sarvagasana (1 min) : The volunteer lies flat on the back and raises the legs and back until he stands on the shoulders. The chin is kept against the chest and the legs are kept vertical. This posture is done for one minute. iii) Matsyasana (1 min) : This Asana is   performed in lying down position by starting with the sitting position with legs folded. After this, the person lies down on the ground in such a way that only the head and buttocks   touch the ground and the back remains in the form of arch.  Thereafter, with the hands one touches the toes and takes a regular deep breathing in this posture for one   minute. iv) Paschimotanasana (1 min) : The person lies down flat on the ground and then raises his upper part of the body gradually in such a way that it touches the outstretched legs, without bending at the knees and the face is kept between the knees. v) Halasana (1 min) : In this posture, at first the person lies on the back, raises the legs and back and then swings over the legs in such a way  that toes of his legs touch the ground over his head. The arms remain straight along the ground. During this procedure knees and legs are   kept straight and tight. vi) Bhujangasana (1 min) : In this  Asana, the person lies down on the floor with face down or prone position. Then he lifts his upper half of the body above the navel by supporting it with outstretched hand, forearm and arm. Then he throws back and stretches the head, neck and trunk in such a way that the posture looks like a serpent in rage. This posture is maintained for one minute. vii) Salabhasana (1 min) Here, the person lies on the prone or face down position and tries to lift his legs up without bending the knee. At the same time, the upper part of the body including the chin is on the ground and the arms are kept extended by the side of the body to give full support to the body weight.  Then, one tries to raise the head and shoulders and throws them backwards as much as possible by extending the neck. viii) Padmasana (1 min): In this Asana,   one sits with the legs extended forward. Bends one leg, placing the foot on the top of the other thigh with the sole upward and the heel touching the pelvic bond. Then he folds the other leg so that the foot rests in a similar position on the opposite thigh.(2) i) After doing the Asanas, one sits in a comfortable posture sukhasana or lotus posture (padmasana) and closes his eyes.  Thereafter, the volunteer is advised to : - Perform Pranayama. The practitioner takes a deep expiration, closes one nostril with middle finger,   takes a deep inspiration for 4 seconds, holds it for 16 seconds and expires the air in 8 seconds. At the same ration, the practitioner repeats the performance, through the other   nostril by closing the first one by the thumb alternately.

Caregivers in the experimental group were provided with the program by a psychiatric nurse and an associate professor in sports health science. The program was planned in accordance with ergonomics and the physiological characteristics of caregivers. Warming (10 min) was the soft physical activity of the muscles, joints, respiratory system, and circulatory system performed at the beginning of an exercise session to prepare the body for active exercise. Rhythmic exercise (20 min) was the phase in which the exercise program was implemented. To speed up the respiratory, circulatory, and locomotor systems, moderate activities including 22 simple movements (3\u20136 metabolic equivalent [ME]) were chosen for this phase. The phase began with proper breathing, and then continued with stretching and stamina exercises (repeating exercise of each muscle group 4 times or more). The duration and intensity of 22 rhythmic exercise activities were chosen by the caregiver. The ME level was measured for each exercise. ME assesses the concept of an individual\u2019s level of physical activity. The ME is the amount of oxygen used by the body during physical activity as a unit in the calculation. Cool-down (10 min) exercises were performed to enable the lactic acids accumulated in the muscles and blood to quickly return to normal levels, gradually lowering the heart rate and blood pressure, which had increased following the activity program. After 10 minutes of low-intensity exercise, the exercises were completed. For walking (40 min), a suitable area was selected for the participants to walk easily in normal steps and in balance. Caregivers were given a comfortable and balanced walk in the open area during normal steps for this phase. The authors participated in the Physical Activity Program and performed all activities with the caregivers.

Participants were asked to attend two onsite, 60-min sessions per week, each session was at least one day apart to allow sufficient recovery. All sessions had two components: (a) 50 min of resistance exercise and (b) 10 min of BA counseling. In addition, up to 50 min of resistance exercise was assigned for at home completion each week. The 50 min of supervised exercise was a full-body, individualized RT program consisting of 5 min of warm up (i.e., on a stationary bike), 40 min of RT, and 5 min of cool down (i.e., stretching). Individualization regarding intensity was based on the results of the initial strength test (completed as part of baseline assessments). Individualization regarding movements was based on what equipment and space the participant regularly had access to outside of sessions. This design allowed participants to do the same movements with similar equipment during supervised and at home RT. During weeks 1\u20133, participants were taught the proper form for multiple upper and lower body exercises. During weeks 4\u201312, participants completed a full-body routine at our facility that was similar to the routine they were asked to complete at home (i.e., one that could be completed in their physical home space).

For the theoretical part, the participants\u2019 past exercise experiences and current status were evaluated; goals were defined, analyzed and divided into small tasks. Discrepancies between the current and desired physical activity status were identified. Together with the patient, the sports therapist discussed the advantages and disadvantages of increased sports activity, examined factors which might promote or complicate exercise, and formulated a daily and weekly plan. General information on healthy eating and the effects of sports and exercise on health was provided. The results from the baseline assessments were explained and used to tailor the activities to the patient\u2019s individual health and fitness status. The overall goal was to meet general activity recommendations and to find individual activities that the participants were interested in continuing on their own.

The Nintendo game console and Ring Fit Adventure program were used. The Ring Fit Adventure program uses Ring-Con and Joy-Con to monitor body movements. Ring-Con is a circular controller with a diameter of approximately 30 cm and is constructed of elastic material. It is used as an armed sensor by attaching the Joy-Con (R) to it and is equipped with a precise force sensor that can recognize tightening and pulling movements. In addition, the movement of each body part is reflected in the game using Joy-Con\u2019s acceleration and gyro sensors mounted on the Ring-Con and leg strap. Among the games available on the Ring Fit program, we selected lower-extremity muscle strength and balance games. The final decision was made by the collective opinion of experts in older adult exercise dynamics. The exergame program consisted of a 10 min warm-up, 30 min of exercise, and a 10 min cool-down. The warm-up exercise consisted of stretching using the Ring Fit program and a leg massage using a massage ball. For the exercise portion, the adventure mode was selected. The participants performed yoga to increase balance, and leg and abdominal exercises to strengthen the lower-extremity muscles. Ring Fit adventure involves exploring more than 20 different worlds and using real-life exercises to defeat the bodybuilder dragon and his minions. Jogging in place to cross grassy plains and climb stairs is expected to strengthen the lower extremities\u2019 strength and improve the participants\u2019 dynamic balance ability. Exercises to defeat the bodybuilder dragon and his subordinates consist of strength training of the arms, abdomen, and legs and yoga exercises to improve balance. Leg exercises include squats, knee lifts, thigh presses, wide squats, and side steps. Abdominal exercises include knee to chest, plank, leg raise, and seated ring raise. Arm exercises include overhead press, front press, bow pull, triceps kick back, and back press. Yoga exercises include warrior 1 pose (lunge pose), revolved crescent lunge pose, warrior 2 (wide stance pose), and warrior 3 pose (single-leg stance pose). As players complete a level, their score increases, and the game\u2019s difficulty gradually increases. Participants are designed to perform various exercises while immersing themselves in virtual reality. The cool-down portion consisted of stretching and breathing exercises. Prior to commencing the exercise regimen, the researcher ensured that the home environment was suitable for physical activity by checking the distance from the TV and securing the exercise area. In addition, the researcher installed console devices at each elderly participant\u2019s home and provided instructions on how to use them to both the participants and their family helpers. Finally, the researcher laid a non-slip mat on the floor and explained how to perform the exercises. If fatigue, pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness were present, participants were asked to stop exercising and contact the researcher. Finally, the researcher asked participants to report by phone or text message after the exercise. The experimental and control groups participated in online education on fall prevention and musculoskeletal health management for 50 min once a week for eight weeks. Online training was conducted using a video-conference application. The training contents included education on aging and musculoskeletal disorders, fall prevention strategies, and falls and fractures under the instructor\u2019s guidance.","PMID":37107943,"Scores":70},{"ProtocolNumber":707,"ProtocolName":"Web-based physical activity intervention","Classification":"Aerobic exercise;Balance exercise;Resistance exercise;Flexibility exercise","Frequency":"NA","Intensity ":"Moderate or vigorous","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"NA","TimesPerSession":"NA","Type":"NA","Volume":"\u2265150 or 75","PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"NA","CoolDown":"NA","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"10 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"NA","ExerciseContraindications":"Medical condition or diagnosis prohibiting physical activity (PA);Severe visual or other impairments;Implanted cardiac devices;Occasional syncopal episodes;Cognitive impairment;Certain medical conditions or severe health impairments.","CombinationTherapy":"Web-based materials","Protocol":"According to the PA recommendations of the WHO and the American College of Sports Medicine, older adults randomized to the IGs were advised to engage in physical exercises.

In accordance with the recommended moderate physical activity levels, the patients were requested to complete three 60-min sessions per week for 8 weeks. Each course included 5 min of warm-up, 50 min of supervised group exercise and 5 min of stretching. During the 50-min main course, which included aerobic and anaerobic exercise, the subjects were required to get 50 %\u201380 % of the maximum heart rate as monitored through real-time heart rate monitors. We used the SPOVAN real-time heart rate belt, which is worn on the chest and can provide real-time heart rate detection and ECG detection.

Group physical activities, such as group games and competitions, should be set up every session to facilitate better communication and interaction among the subjects.  A WeChat group chat was established to share experiences after classes, led by professional exercise instructors and clinical scientists to help the subjects build confidence and encouragement to continue participating in the activities. This was achieved through discussing some topics, such as identifying the barriers to exercise and techniques to overcome them, goal setting, positive and negative effects of exercise and so on. The subjects were asked to maintain their original exercise habits in their daily lives, and the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, traditional Chinese medicine, physical therapy or systematic psychotherapy was prohibited. In case of severe insomnia, benzodiazepines or non-benzodiazepines were allowed but could not be continuously used for >7 days.

The program features a series of animated and video demonstrations of exercises that involve repetitive movements, designed to engage and challenge various muscle groups. These movements are performed rhythmically and in a coordinated manner to enhance muscular strength and cardiorespiratory endurance. The program\u2019s exercises are repeated several times during each sequence, and 3D animated images display movements designed to enhance coordination and balance by integrating hand and leg movements in different ways. The program\u2019s movements challenge the hands, feet, and trunk and are designed to improve muscular strength and cardiorespiratory endurance. More specifically, the program is composed of 6 therapeutic movement sequences, each incorporating specific fitness elements. The first and second sequences were designed to proceed more quickly and include mostly arm exercises. Some specific examples of exercises in these sequences include movements such as alternating arm and leg raises while standing on 1 leg. These exercises require participants to use their core muscles to stabilize their bodies while moving their limbs. In addition, the combination of upper and lower body movements can help to improve cardiovascular fitness by increasing the heart rate and respiratory rate. The third and fourth sequences in the program focus on coordinated movements of both the arms and legs. The exercises are aimed at expanding the range of motion around the body\u2019s center of gravity and enhancing muscular endurance and balance. It involves standing with the feet hip-width apart and lifting both arms up and out to the sides of the body, reaching toward the sky. The palms of the hands may face each other or be turned outward. The chest and head are lifted upward to create an expansive posture. This movement is often associated with a feeling of openness and energy, as it stretches and opens the chest, shoulders, and arms. By coordinating the movements of both the arms and legs, participants are required to use multiple muscle groups simultaneously, which can help to improve overall body strength and coordination. The fifth sequence involves walking and running in place to improve cardiorespiratory capacity. This sequence is specifically designed to improve cardiorespiratory capacity or the ability of the body\u2019s cardiovascular and respiratory systems to efficiently deliver oxygen and nutrients to the muscles during physical activity. To perform this sequence, the participant simply walks or runs in place, lifting their feet off the ground and moving their arms back and forth in a natural rhythm. Walking and running in place can be modified to increase the intensity of the exercise by incorporating variations such as high knees, heel kicks, or lateral shuffles. These variations can challenge the cardiovascular and respiratory systems by increasing the intensity and demand of the exercise. The sixth sequence is designed to enhance coordination between the arms and legs, with the aim of increasing the range of motion around joints. For example, 1 exercise involves lunging forward with 1 leg while simultaneously extending the arm out in front of the body and then alternating sides. Another exercise involves standing with the feet shoulder-width apart and lifting both arms straight up above the head while simultaneously bending the knees and lowering the body into a squat position. Participants may then return to the standing position while lowering the arms to the sides of the body. In addition, the program\u2019s movement exercises consist of actions with characteristics similar to gestures associated with the expression of positive emotions (joy and happiness). The body motions associated with expressions of joy and happiness have the characteristics of expansiveness, wherein the upper extremities and upper body move upward, with the arms extending laterally. This typically involves raising both arms and reaching them outward to the sides of the body while also lifting the chest and head upward to create an expansive, uplifting posture. This upward stretching of the hands also has a stress-reducing effect. The participants follow the movements of positive emotional expression while upbeat music plays in the background, which can also reduce depression. Moving in rhythm requires the user to engage in active behavior as opposed to psychomotor retardation, which is a behavioral trait associated with depression. Only participants in the treatment group were instructed to engage in physical activity while watching videos with physical activity content 5 times a week for 4 weeks. The videos consisted of a total of approximately 20 minutes of physical activity content and were delivered to the participants\u2019 mobile devices through a YouTube link at the same time every day. The researchers did not provide additional treatment or counseling related to the program content.","PMID":37358905,"Scores":80},{"ProtocolNumber":715,"ProtocolName":"Aerobic exercise","Classification":"Aerobic exercise","Frequency":2,"Intensity ":"Moderate","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"RPE(12-14)\/(Borg 6-20);HRmax(70-80)","TimesPerSession":40,"Type":"Running and stationary bike","Volume":120,"PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"10min","CoolDown":"10min","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"24 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Dementia;Musculoskeletal injuries, cardiovascular (e.g., acute pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction), and neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinson\u2019s disease).","CombinationTherapy":"Antidepressant medication","Protocol":"The aerobic exercise (AE) and AE with motor complexity (AEMC) groups trained twice a week for 24 weeks, in different facilities.

In this way, the number of calories consumed and the required steps would depend on the participant\u2019s body weight.","PMID":35864774,"Scores":60},{"ProtocolNumber":739,"ProtocolName":"Yoga therapy program","Classification":"Yoga","Frequency":1,"Intensity ":"NA","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"NA","TimesPerSession":60,"Type":"Stretching and body warm-up exercises and basic sun salutation exercises (20-minute duration);Physical and postural exercises, called Asana (20-minute duration);Breathing exercises (i.e., Pranayama) and meditation (10-minute duration);Relaxation or Shavasana (10-minute duration).

The yoga therapy program comprised eight 60-minute sessions held for eight consecutive weeks (one session per week). Each session included a set of yogic practices as follows: (1) stretching and body warm-up exercises and basic sun salutation exercises (20-minute duration), (2) physical and postural exercises, called Asana (20-minute duration), (3) breathing exercises (i.e., Pranayama) and meditation (10-minute duration), and (4) relaxation or Shavasana (10-minute duration). Asana exercises varied in each session, while other practices were similar during all sessions.  The yogic practices of each session must be performed by adolescents every day from Saturday to Friday. It was impossible to present the sessions in the clinical setting during the lockdown period of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); hence, the adolescents performed all yogic practices in their homes under the supervision of their parents. The adolescents and one of their parents were requested to join a WhatsApp group to better manage the yogic home practices. Also, before each yoga therapy session was initiated, we presented a virtual training session on performing the Asana exercises. To this end, eight group training sessions were scheduled, including one online and seven offline sessions. The online session, which was the first session, was held through Adobe Connect Reader for 90 min. At the end of this session, adolescents were given a video containing instructions presented during the session for more review. For the seven offline training sessions, we shared a 20-minute video containing instructions on related exercises of the session in the created WhatsApp group. Additionally, for other yogic practices (i.e., stretching and body warm-up exercises, basic sun salutation exercises, Pranayama exercises, meditation, and Shavasana), a 40-minute instructional video was shared in the WhatsApp group before the initiation of the first yoga therapy session. After sharing the instructional video of each yoga therapy session, the adolescents were encouraged to watch them before performing the yogic practices of the session. Before each yoga therapy session, the principal investigator reminded the adolescents of the session via phone calls. Also, she checked the quality of yogic home practices during phone calls to ensure against adolescents\u2019 understatements of problems or resolve any issues. Furthermore, each adolescent was requested to record at least a video from her yogic home practices during each session and then send it to the principal investigator through WhatsApp in a private message. Consequently, the principal investigator sent the received video to the yoga therapist, who gave the adolescent feedback through WhatsApp messages or voice calls. If any of the adolescents overlooked the yogic home practices of a session or did not perform them appropriately, any issues were discussed and resolved. Then, they were asked to complete the exercises correctly in the following days based on the instructions. Additionally, to avoid between-group communication during in-person routine care sessions, the yoga therapy arm was planned to be in the clinic on odd daytimes. In contrast, we requested the control arm to refer to the clinic on even days.","PMID":37975133,"Scores":70},{"ProtocolNumber":740,"ProtocolName":"Virtual reality indoor cycling program","Classification":"Aerobic exercise","Frequency":"3-5","Intensity ":"Light","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"Gear 2(out of 10 gears);RPE(slightly out of breath)","TimesPerSession":30,"Type":"Indoor bicycle","Volume":"150-250","PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"10min(stretching)","CoolDown":"10min","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"NA","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"8 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"NA","ExerciseContraindications":"History of orthopedic diseases or recent surgery;Complained of cybersickness and headaches;Visual or auditory impairments.","CombinationTherapy":"Virtual reality background and music","Protocol":"The exercise intervention in this study consisted of 10 min of warm-up, 30 min of the main exercise, and 10 min of finishing exercise, for a total duration of 50 min.

As soon as tests were completed at the hospital, the Yoga teacher (DT) contacted the patient. An email was sent explaining the four core rules of the module: 1. Face-to-face sessions during weekends. 2. Inform the teacher 48 h in advance if there is an agenda conflict. 3. Regular practice throughout the module (daily). 4. Commitment to practice until the end of the fourteen-week module. In this introductory email, the proposed plan was already set up: face-to-face consultations on Week 1, Week 3, Week 8 and Week 14, so that each patient has sufficient time to arrange for those meetings. Week 1 (1h30): a dialogue was initiated to gain an in-depth understanding of the patient\u2019s insomnia issue. The practice was designed via a co-creation process with the patient, in order to individualise the practice according to patient\u2019s characteristics. Week 3 (1h): the practice was reviewed and adjusted based on the patient\u2019s feedback. Week 8 (1h): the practice was discussed again and fine-tuned. Week 14 (1h30): the overall Yoga program was debriefed and final recommendations were provided to the patient for continuing the practice of Yoga independently. Thus, an assessment was done during each face-to-face session and patients were also allowed to contact the Yoga teacher to clarify their practice, when required. To provide additional support, an A4 sheet describing the practice in the form of the stick-figures described earlier was given to the patient at the end of each consultation. If necessary, guided meditations were recorded and provided to the patients by e-mail. The ultimate goal, however, was that patients would become empowered to continue practicing on their own by the end of the 14-week module. In the TKV Desikachar\u2019s translation of the Yoga S\u016btra of Pantanjali, Yoga is defined as \u201cthe ability to direct the mind exclusively towards an object and sustain that direction without any distractions\u201d. This is the essence of how Yoga was taught in this study. Several tools can be used in yoga, but a fundamental tool used in all practices was to help patients reconnect with their breathing. Indeed Yoga establishes a direct connection between one\u2019s breathing pattern and one\u2019s state of mind. Learning to focus and gradually to better control the breathing helps to better control the mind and to reduce the flow of thoughts which often prevents patients from falling asleep or to fall back to sleep. The essence of Viniyoga is to tune the practice to each patient. This is essential for patients to adhere to the practice. The individualised consultations took into account the context of patients in a very broad sense to best adapt the practice to patient\u2019s needs: the nature of sleeping issue (difficulty falling asleep, difficulty returning to sleep, early wake up, lack of energy during the day, etc.), the time available to practice, the patient\u2019s personal context (life surroundings, parent with children, elderly), lifestyle (eating and drinking habits, nature of activities prior to sleep). The Yoga teacher stressed the importance of regular practice (i.e. daily), rather than its length. Some exercises were also given during the day to help embed new ways of focussing. The nature of the exercises was such that patients were able to practice them almost anywhere: in their bedroom, just before going to sleep, in bed if the night was interrupted, in the morning while waking up, at work at their desk, in public transport, or in public places, in order to ensure frequent and regular practice. All exercises provided were actually practiced with the patient, until the patient was sufficiently autonomous to practice on his own at home. This was also essential to help patient practice daily. Unlike sport, where it is usual to feel pain during or after the exercise, Viniyoga emphasizes that patients should learn to respect their body. There was a step-by-step progression (called Vinyasa Krama in Yoga) week after week, but also within the practice. This progression ensured that patients could practice Yoga safely and within their own limits. Practices could take from five minutes, two to three times a day, up to 30 min. Yoga exercises included a variety of traditional Yoga tools such as postures (\u0100sana), breathing practices (Pr\u0101n\u0101y\u0101ma), visualisations (Bh\u0101van\u0101), coordination of breathing with touching one\u2019s own body (Ny\u0101sa), meditation (Dhy\u0101na), and sometimes the use of mantra. Yoga often involves repeating the same exercise a specific amount of times, which requires focus. Most patients have difficulty counting in their heads while focusing on breathing and movement. To make it easier, patients are taught the simple Yoga finger counting system where the thumb is used as a pointer touching each phalange one after the other. All these tools can be combined to best suit the patient\u2019s needs and preferences. Though many of these exercises are broadly applicable, specifics of these practices might not necessarily be appropriate to all patients.","PMID":35421962,"Scores":65},{"ProtocolNumber":749,"ProtocolName":"Multicomponent physical exercise intervention","Classification":"Resistance exercise","Frequency":1,"Intensity ":"Moderate","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"RPE(12-15)\/(Borg 6-20)","TimesPerSession":25,"Type":"Calf raises: 2 sets, 10\u201315 rep; Sit to stand from chair: 2 sets, 10 rep; Lateral lunge: (maximal length) 2\/3 leg length from anterior superior iliac spine(ASIS) to internal malleolus, 2 sets, 10\u201315 rep; Forward lunge: (maximal length) 2\/3 Leg length from ASIS to internal malleolus, 2 sets, 10\u201315 rep; Stair climbing: upstairs downstairs, 2 sets, 10 rep.","Volume":150,"PeriodsOfTime":"Mondays","WarmUp":"5min(Range of motion of different joints)","CoolDown":"5min(Breathing and relaxing exercises\/drink water and\/or fruit)","NumberOfSetsPerSession":2,"TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"10\u201315","Progress":"YES","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"3 months","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Clinically unstable by the medical professionals of the center;Have any other condition in which entering the study would not be in the participant\u2019s best interests.","CombinationTherapy":"NA","Protocol":"Participants in the intervention group(IG) performed a three-month long multicomponent physical exercise intervention. The programme included strength and balance exercises and was designed by physical activity professionals. Fifty-min supervised group sessions (ranged from 4 to 5 participants at a time) directed to improve strength and balance were conducted three times a week nonconsecutive. All sessions began with a warm-up of 5-min and after 40-min training, the session finished with 5 min of breathing and relaxing exercises, drinking water, and\/or eating fruit. Program adherence was considered when they participated in at least 70% of the sessions. The exercises were designed by professionals in physical activity and geriatrics and adapted to the particular requirements of the functional capacity of each participant. The sessions began with a brief warm-up of 5 min of joint range-of-motion exercises. Strength training comprised exercises of moderate intensity for the upper and lower body, which were performed individually and progressively with external weights. They could use the hand for support if necessary. Strength exercises were focused on lower extremity strengthening (calf raises, sit to stand from a chair, lateral lunge, forward lunge, and stair climbing). Volume and execution velocity increments were used to achieve training progression and based on the perceived effort of the individual using the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) 6\u201320 scale, increasing or decreasing the number of repetitions, the speed and the loads. Physical exercise of moderate intensity was to be maintained according to the perceived effort measured by the Borg scale in a range of 12\u201315.

The target was to get persons to participate in these exercise sessions two to three times a week, because this is in line with the public health recommendations by CDC\/American College of Sports Medicine and its established successful effects on depression and anxiety. Patients were gradually assigned individual training ranges equivalent to 70\u201385 % of their heart rate reserve, calculated from the heart rate achieved during a baseline cycle ergometer test with the formula of Karvonen et al.. This intensity level was confirmed to be effective in decreasing depressive symptoms. At the beginning of the running intervention, the running therapist discussed experience of exercise in the past, and provided information about food, moisture balance, fatigue, injuries, sleep and recovery. Running sessions were carried out and supervised by qualified staff, starting with a 10-minute warming-up exercise period, followed by 30 min of jogging at an intensity that maintained heart rate within the assigned training range (starting in the first 4 weeks at 50\u201370 % of heart rate reserve and in the subsequent 12 weeks at 70\u201385 % of heart rate reserve), and finishing with 5 min of cooling-down exercises. During the running sessions, all participants wore a heart rate monitor. Heart rate was confirmed three times per session to ensure that patients were exercising within the prescribed exercise training ranges. Data of the heart rate monitor was uploaded after sessions and used to encourage study compliance. Patients were stimulated to participate in at least two of the organized exercise group sessions per week, but if not possible, home-based individual exercise was partly allowed. The trainer monitored training attendance, which was supplemented by the heart rate monitor data. Following evidence-based recommendations, being running therapy adherent was defined as exercising at least 70 % of the target of two times per week for 16 weeks (=0.70 \u2217 (2 \u2217 16) = 22.4), so those with >22 sessions of running therapy within 16 weeks were considered compliant.

The exercise intensity was also monitored with the use of the 0\u201310 Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) and the Talk Test. The workout intervals consisted of exercises involving the main muscle groups (e.g., squats, lunges, jumps, combined with the upper body movements). They lasted for 30\u201360 s, alternating with a 30\u201360 s rest break, in the ratio of exercise time to rest 1:2, 1:1 or 2:1, according to the individual capabilities of the participant and taking into account the training progression and stage of pregnancy. Following the interval part of the training, participants performed resistance, postural, neuromotor (e.g., body balance) and stretching exercises (5\u201310 min). The cool down included pelvic floor muscle exercises and preparation-for-birth exercises, e.g., birth position and breathing exercises (5\u201310 min) and also relaxation and visualization of pregnancy and childbirth (5\u201315 min). No equipment was used during exercises and only resistance of own body was applied. Participants could attend the exercise program regardless of their level of fitness or exercise capacity, as well as the level of motor skills (based on the diagnostic exercise tests, the exercise program was tailored to the individual exercise capabilities).

The Tai Chi program aims to enhance participants' neurocognitive functions by improving their cardiovascular fitness, motor fitness, movement coordination, social interaction, and meditation status. Thus, a three-month (12-week) Tai Chi program was designed to cater to these five dimensions. During the 90-minute twice-weekly sessions, the participants engaged in 15 minutes of warm-ups (cardiovascular fitness, CRF) that included 3 minutes of jogging and 12 minutes of Tai Chi footwork practice; 10 minutes of Tai Chi kicking and stretching (motor fitness) that included left and right heel kicks, Tai Chi bow stance stretching, Tai Chi horse-riding stance stretching, and Tai Chi crouch stance stretching; 40 minutes of 10-form Tai Chi (movement coordination); 15 minutes of Tai Chi interaction, which included Tai Chi pushing-hands, Tai Chi sharing, Tai Chi grouping practice, and Tai Chi game playing (social interaction); and 10 minutes of Tai Chi meditation (meditation status). In order to conform to the above model design, the Dong Yue (East Mountain) style of Tai Chi, which was created by professors Hui-Feng Men and Gui-Xiang Kan of Beijing Sport University in China, was used in the present study. Ten basic, common Dong Yue Tai Chi movements were selected and modified by an experienced Tai Chi instructor: (1) Qi Shi (Commencing Form); (2) Huai Bao Ri Yue (Embrace the Sun and Moon); (3) Xuan Zhuan Qian Kun-Yi (Reverse the Rotation of the Universe-One); (4) Kai He Zhuang (Arms Open and Close Posture); (5) Xuan Zhuan Qian Kun-Er (Reverse the Rotation of the Universe-Two); (6) Sheng Jiang Zhuang (Rise and Fall Posture); (7) Yun Shou (Cloud Hands); (8) Jin Ji Du Li (Golden Rooster Standing on One Foot); (9) Huai Bao Ri Yue (Embrace the Sun and Moon); and (10) Shou Shi (Closing Form). These movements were selected because they are safe, simple, of low-intensity, and easy to learn. Beginners could develop their muscle strength, coordination, and balancing skills through the abovementioned activities, which require them to breathe, think, and move simultaneously. Specifically, the Tai Chi program developed in this study entails specialized activities and movements that aim to improve a particular function; for example, jogging and Tai Chi footwork promote participants' cardiovascular fitness, while Tai Chi pushing-hands and group games foster social interactions.

AE was performed as brisk walking and jogging using treadmills. Each AE session consisted of four parts: warm-up, main exercise, cool-down, and stretching. The percentage of heart rate reserve (%HRR) was used to measure the exercise intensity. Average prior-intervention resting heart rate (RHR) for 3 consecutive days, assessed by carotid artery measurement (10-s \u00d7 6-s), was used to compute %HRR. Following the principle of progressive physical activity, AE intensity was initially set at 50 \u223c 60% of HRR and gradually progressed up to 60 \u223c 75% and 75 \u223c 90% of HRR. To assess whether participants met the target exercise intensity, post-exercise heart rate (HR) was measured immediately after performing Main Exercise. The target post-exercise heart rate (PEHR) was calculated using the %HRR formula: %HRR = (HR exercise \u2212 RHR)\/(HR max \u2212 RHR) \u00d7 100%, where HR max = 216.6 \u2212 0.84 \u00d7 age.

After each AE session, participants were also instructed to measure RHR on the following day to determine if there was a fatigue accumulation (no fatigue accumulation: the increase of RHR < 5 beats\/min). We used ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), HR and RH to assess whether participants had adapted to exercise intensity.

The RT was performed with dumbbells and elastic bands. Similar to the AE group, each RT session consisted of warm-up, main exercise, cool-down and stretching. The finalized RT exercise consisted of six upper-limb (bicep curl, lateral raise, shoulder outward rotation, triceps kickback, and bent Y- and TW-shaped stretch) and six lower-limb plus core exercises (X-band walks, clam-like opening and closing, kneeling hip extension, dynamic glute bridge, and wall squat and plank). The initial intensity was set at 20 repetitions maximum (RM). In order to compare the intensity of 2 experimental groups, the RPE was also used for participants in RT group to assess the post-exercise fatigue. To avoid muscle fatigue accumulation, participants were instructed to alternate between upper-limb and lower-limb plus core exercises during the intervention. The total duration of each repetition, which included both concentric and eccentric phases, was approximately 2-4 s. In addition, participants were instructed to exhale on the concentric phase and inhale on the eccentric phase. Prior to intervention implementation, the researchers conducted a pre-experiment to determine the optimal exercise modalities and training load of the RT session. According to the results of the pre-experiment, we can find the relatively weak aspects of participants and increase targeted resistance exercises. As mentioned above, the RT was progressive in terms of training load or repetitions. If a participant could complete the standard action of the last group for more than two repetitions in two consecutive sessions, the RPE remained unchanged or even decreased and there was no exercise fatigue, the participant would progress to the next stage. The criterion of fatigue accumulation was the same as that of AT group.","PMID":36699477,"Scores":90},{"ProtocolNumber":770,"ProtocolName":"Individualized aerobic training program","Classification":"Aerobic exercise","Frequency":5,"Intensity ":"NA","IntensityCalculationIndicator":"HR;RPE","TimesPerSession":"30-40","Type":"Cycle ergometer","Volume":"150-200","PeriodsOfTime":"NA","WarmUp":"10min","CoolDown":"10min","NumberOfSetsPerSession":"NA","TimeOfEachSet":"NA","RepetitionsPerSet":"NA","Progress":"YES","IntertrialInterval":"NA","Duration":"8 weeks","MedicalSupervision":"Yes","ExerciseContraindications":"Patients with overt cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes.","CombinationTherapy":"NA","Protocol":"Only the intervention group participated in the individualized, HR targeted, aerobic training program, which consisted of exercises on a cycle ergometer for 30\u201340 min\/day, 5 days\/week for 8 weeks (40 individual sessions in total). The aerobic training protocol was developed based on the standard recommendations for incremental aerobic exercise and was adapted for untrained subjects with MetS. Each aerobic exercise training session consisted of three phases: warm-up, exercise training, cool-down. The warm-up phase lasted 10 minutes. For the first 5 minutes of warm-up, exercise intensity was set to 25 W, and for the next 5 minutes, it was gradually increased until the training HR was reached. During the exercise training phase, the intensity of exercise was maintained at such a level that the training HR remained constant. The cool-down phase also lasted 10 minutes. The exercise intensity was gradually reduced to 25 W for the first 5 minutes, while a constant exercise intensity of 25 W was maintained for the last 5 minutes. The pedaling frequency throughout each session was 60 rpm. During the first 2 weeks of the individualized aerobic training program, the duration of the exercise training phase was increased from 30 minutes to 40 minutes (every 2 sessions for 2 minutes) and the intensity of exercise was maintained at HR for initial training (HR registered at VT1 during CPET). During the third and fourth week, the intensity of exercise was gradually increased up to the target HR, which was individually estimated at VT2 or AT during CPET. For the remaining 4 weeks of the individualized aerobic training program, the exercise intensity was maintained at the target HR. To adjust exercise intensity and monitor HR, we used the Ergoline Rehabilitation System-2 (ERS-2), which enabled us to control the load of the cycle ergometer, so that the patient's HR would be at a targeted level during the exercise training phase. Targeted HR was carefully monitored and maintained at all times, and the deviation from the target HR was insignificant. The Borg Perceived Exertion 6 to 20 scale was used to evaluate the effort of the patient to exercise during each session. The HR targeted aerobic training program was designed to be implemented into the clinical practice. The program was conducted at the outpatient clinic and was supervised by a team of rehabilitation specialists and cardiologists.","PMID":35439631,"Scores":85}]
