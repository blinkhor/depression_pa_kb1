The gain of the transfer  function quantifies the intensity of the response of the output signal (RRi) per unit of spontaneous change of the input signal (RESP), while  the phase measures the time lag between these signals. The function of K2 measures the degree of linear coupling between RRi and RESP at  the same frequency in both variability signals. In the present study, the  cardiorespiratory coupling was quantified by means of K2 index in the  central frequency (\u03c9) within HF range (0.15\u20130.40 Hz) and expressed  in percentage units.","PMID":28285240.0},{"Group name":"Treatment","Content":"Comprehensive physical fitness assessment","Variable name":"HR","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"median[interquartil ranges]","Value":"73 [66\u201384]","Unit":"bpm","Method":"NA","PMID":28285240.0},{"Group name":"Total","Content":"Cardiorespiratory fitness","Variable name":"VO2max","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"1.7 (0.6)","Unit":"min","Method":"NA","PMID":27936452.0},{"Group name":"Total","Content":"Balance","Variable name":"Static balance,mediolateral (eyes open)","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"4.46(2.15)","Unit":"scores","Method":"NA","PMID":29643594.0},{"Group name":"Total","Content":"Balance","Variable name":"Static balance,mediolateral (eyes closed)","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"4.80(2.37)","Unit":"scores","Method":"NA","PMID":29643594.0},{"Group name":"Total","Content":"Balance","Variable name":"Static balance,anteroposterior (eyes open)","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"10.16(5.06)","Unit":"scores","Method":"NA","PMID":29643594.0},{"Group name":"Total","Content":"Balance","Variable name":"Static balance,anteroposterior (eyes closed)","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"13.44(8.50)","Unit":"scores","Method":"NA","PMID":29643594.0},{"Group name":"Total","Content":"Balance","Variable name":"Static balance,body sway (eyes open)","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"17.02(14.10)","Unit":"scores","Method":"NA","PMID":29643594.0},{"Group name":"Total","Content":"Balance","Variable name":"Static balance,body sway (eyes closed)","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"22.02(24.25)","Unit":"scores","Method":"NA","PMID":29643594.0},{"Group name":"Total","Content":"Balance","Variable name":"Static balance,total score (eyes open)","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"48.00(22.63)","Unit":"scores","Method":"NA","PMID":29643594.0},{"Group name":"Total","Content":"Balance","Variable name":"Static balance,total score (eyes closed)","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"65.26(25.51)","Unit":"scores","Method":"NA","PMID":29643594.0},{"Group name":"Total","Content":"Balance","Variable name":"Activities-specific balance confidence Scale (Korean version)","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"58.71(7.28)","Unit":"scores","Method":"NA","PMID":29643594.0},{"Group name":"Exercise","Content":"Cardiorespiratory fitness","Variable name":"FVC ","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"2.51(0.96)","Unit":"L","Method":"NA","PMID":28479901.0},{"Group name":"Exercise","Content":"Cardiorespiratory fitness","Variable name":"FEV1","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"1.47(0.63)","Unit":"L","Method":"NA","PMID":28479901.0},{"Group name":"Exercise","Content":"Cardiorespiratory fitness","Variable name":"FEV1\/FVC","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"48.86(9.12)","Unit":"%","Method":"NA","PMID":28479901.0},{"Group name":"Exercise","Content":"Cardiorespiratory fitness","Variable name":"MVV ","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"47.16(10.87)","Unit":"L\/min","Method":"NA","PMID":28479901.0},{"Group name":"Depressed","Content":"Cardiorespiratory fitness","Variable name":"VO2peak","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"37.2(7.1)","Unit":"ml\/kg\/min","Method":"Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 peak) was assessed by a maximal oxygen consumption test using a motor-driven treadmill and a modified Bruce protocol.

The composite score for each domain was then calculated as the sum of each item score.","PMID":19994724.0},{"Group name":"Exercise","Content":"Cardiorespiratory fitness","Variable name":"METs at stress test","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"10.69 (1.72)","Unit":"METs","Method":"NA","PMID":18373127.0},{"Group name":"Supervised aerobic exercise","Content":"Cardiorespiratory fitness","Variable name":"V\u0307O2peak","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"mean","Value":25.2,"Unit":"ml\/kg\/min","Method":"Graded treadmill exercise testing was conducted before and after treatment.

The recorded maximum heart rate (HRmax), blood pressure and VO2max determined the exercise prescription.","PMID":12166700.0},{"Group name":"Total","Content":"Cardiorespiratory fitness","Variable name":"VO2max","Variable type":"Numerical","Classification":"NA","Statistical indicators":"mean(SD)","Value":"28.2 (10.1)","Unit":"ml\/kg\/min","Method":"Maximal physical performance was assessed  at the beginning and end of the study with a  modified Bruce treadmill test under continuous electrocardiogram monitoring.
